obs in Middle East have always been the most sought after career destination by job seekers. Apart from the monetary reasons, what attracts expatriates to cities in Middle East is the warm and welcoming nature of its expatriates. Low crime rate, peaceful environment, law and order in place, luxurious lifestyle-what more can one ask for? The need of companies to employ foreign workforce in their country has led to a high rise in their ever growing population. In fact, today their population has grown so much that it is almost outnumbering the local population in various regions. The trend continues as all the companies-local and international show their readiness in hiring foreigners even for top level positions.

- Draft it in a way that it meets the eligibility and requirements of the positions available in the organization.
  
- Apply only for positions that you deem yourself capable of and can fill them easily.
  
- Dont hope against hope and send out your job application only for a vacancy.
  
- Send your resume only to the key persons of a department and not to the HR. In case that particular firm has an HR recruitment firm, you can try approaching them who can then forward your resume.

It is very important to convince the employers of your skills and expertise. The best part of employers in Middle East is that once they have the conviction about your abilities, they are ready to pay even a little higher to hire you.

Strong networking comes really handy in such situations as jobs known to you through contacts are not advertised on a larger scale ruining the scope of competition. Also, it becomes easier to introduce the employer to your skill sets and abilities that helps in winning his/ her confidence in the test or interview.

At this point, when the company believes that you are good enough to meet the job requirements, you can put forth your salary expectations on a more personal level. You are not competing for the position anymore and have also demonstrated your skills, thus, standing a better chance of success. Do not ask for overestimated amounts and keep yourself humble by avoiding self appraise.
