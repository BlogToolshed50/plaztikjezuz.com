In any business and more so in the financial concerns, the bottom line the extent of the perfection and efficiency with which the business is managed. One among the ratios that vouches for the efficiency of the management is the cost-income ratio. As the word indicates, it is the ratio between the operating expenses and the operating income of the business house or the industry.

In case the ratio is less, it indicates that the cost is less and the income is more benefiting the shareholders. If it is on the reverse, then it speaks badly about the management. The cost includes the expenses of the salary, fixed assets and all other operating expenses. Periodical review of the strategy followed by the financial and other institutions help them take appropriate and timely corrective steps to improve the efficiency of the management and keep the ratio at a lower level.
