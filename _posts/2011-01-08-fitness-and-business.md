Fitness is becoming the buzz word these days. There are just too many websites that are springing up each day about fitness and health. If this is a buzz word, then why not a post on my blog about this topic. A recent statistics show that an American family spends 150$s per year on fitness and good health related products. This is gradually increasing each year and hence the companies that deal with fitness products are planning for a great year ahead. In this current trend of economic slowdown, fitness until remains a pasture land and I suggest you put your money into this area if you are planning to in the near future.
