There are several pros and cons between artificial flowers and fresh flowers. The first thing is with artificial flowers there is very little to clean, no liquids to get split, no dirt to prune, just rest it down and go about your business. Another good feature about artificial flowers is once you have it, there is no reason to spend another dollar buying the same thing, and it will remain for a very long time. They may require a little dusting now and then, but this can easily be accomplished by wiping them with a slightly wet water cloth, or giving them a quick rinse with some soapy liquid. Note not all types artificial flowers can be washed with water. They will never get too big for their vases or pots as the case may be, and will clearly not need any nurturing.

Artificial Flowers are a great gift for a special someone, because they will have them for a very long time after the occasion, unlike real fresh flowers that will most certainly wither and die.They might be a bit expensive but are worth every cent in the long run, because it is like a medium to long term investment where you can see and feel your moneys worth for a long time to come. Another good point to note is they are available everywhere, you do not need to go to the Florist to get a an arrangement, there are many shops which stock these and they can be found in several patterns to suit all occasion, whether it is a Birthday, or Christmas or a wedding anniversary, there are many to choose from.

Fresh flowers on the other hand need special daily care, but they smell so sweet and look so gorgeous that a lot of people would rather use their money on these than on artificial flowers. Even though they know it will only last a week or two. A beautiful arrangement of say fresh carnations given to someone on a special occasion would probably be more loved than an artificial arrangement, because for some reason it feels more loving than an arrangement of artificial flowers.

In the professional world, artificial flowers in the office definitely appears to outnumber the desire for fresh flowers. It is more wise to buy artificial flowers particularly big artificial trees, fern and palm are a good example, to beautify the working environment, without the worry of having to care for them on a daily basis and it also removes the problem of arriving in the office on a Monday morning only to find that the plants are practically dead because they did not receive enough water over the weekend, not to mention the problem of dead leaves and petals all over the floor
