With the advent of various electronic gadgets like television, mobile phones and much more we come across people deprived of their sleep in the night. It is scientifically studied that watching to the television and working on the laptop every evening before going to sleep and playing video games late into the night or checking e-mails and text messages before turning off the lights could be interfering with the people&#8217;s sleep habits. This is found to be due to the exposure to artificial light before going to bed can increase alertness and suppress the release of melatonin, a sleep-promoting hormone.

It is a matter of great concern that the various modern day so-called useful gadgets including the cell phones and computers, which make our lives more productive and enjoyable, maybe abused to the point that they contribute to getting less sleep at night leaving millions functioning poorly the next day in their office. Almost 95 percent of people questioned in a recent study has revealed that they used some type of electronics in the hour before going to bed, and admitted they do not get enough sleep during the week. It is better that we use them with these aspects in mind and lead a healthy life with judicious use.
