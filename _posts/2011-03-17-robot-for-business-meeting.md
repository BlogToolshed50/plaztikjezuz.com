In the recent biggest high tech fair CeBit, people have found themselves bumping into &#8220;Jazz&#8221; a tele-presence robot also ambling around the vast expo. It is created by the French firm Gostai, and is a shiny white humanoid robot that its makers believe could transform business meetings and reduce the need for long distance travel. Controllable by anyone with access to the internet via a laptop or even smart phone, Jazz projects its user&#8217;s presence, showing his or her face on its own face and speaking in its user&#8217;s voice. Launched only two months ago, &#8220;Jazz&#8221; could easily deputies for a manager in a business meeting, or tour a factory or shop floor, both recording and beaming back what it seems to its user according the company source.

The main advantage over teleconferencing is its mobility anywhere which makes the job easier. In fact, the company is coming out with a more sleeker version of the same which will be user-friendly. It can run for five straight hours at around four kilometers per hour without the need for recharge. This robot, quiet and faceless, can be programmed to prowl around a factory or warehouse and alert the authorities if it detects people up to no good. In the present context of reduced margin and the various factors involved in the mobility of the people to attend to the business needs the creation of such type of robots will go a long way to help the business houses to maximize their profit.
