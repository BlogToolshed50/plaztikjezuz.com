As your teens grow older and come closer to adulthood however, it just becomes important to teach them how to be responsible and independent. This is especially true during the teenage years because much of what they learn about the value of hard work, responsibility, and money during this time will shape their adult behaviors.

Teaching a child the value of money is not all that difficult and you can start rather early. Something as simple as having a &#8220;piggy bank&#8221; is great way to teach children how to save early on in life. It&#8217;s a first step towards them learning how to not squander money on small things but rather to save for something more important such as a car, their college education, a home, or for the &#8220;rainy days.&#8221;

It is pretty well known that something given to you rarely has as much value as when you&#8217;ve worked to get it. A sure way of not instilling these values in your children is to give them far more than what they need and without them lifting a finger for it. Buying them expensive clothes or the car they always wanted may make them happy and be important for their status, but you&#8217;ll likely end up teaching them how to be dependent rather than independent.

Even if you paid for your child&#8217;s first car in its entirety, having them continually work to make token payments on it or the insurance premium can instill the sense that they&#8217;ve worked for what they have.

As children get older, working odd or part time jobs can teach them a great deal about responsibility, the value of hard work, and how good it feels to earn what you have.

These times it&#8217;s extremely difficult for a child to buy their first car or to pay for college all by themselves. It&#8217;s hard for parents to do the same, especially if you have multiple children, and especially if you haven&#8217;t started saving early. Not preparing for these expenses could mean having to buy an inexpensive car with constant repair bills that eat up more money in the end.

When it comes to handling money, the example you give your children may be the most potent lesson of all.
