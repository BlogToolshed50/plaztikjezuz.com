Progress is being made on the home-front for those caring for family members suffering from Alzheimer&#8217;s or dementia. Currently, about two-thirds of Americans with those conditions are cared for at home. 

As the disease progresses it carries with it a tremendous burden, both physically and psychologically on the family members-usually the husband, wife or partner&#8211;who are doing the care-giving. That is why it is vital that the family access community support systems, such as local Alzheimer&#8217;s organizations, that can provide reassurance and support groups.

It is also important that family caregivers seek outside help if they feel they are becoming ill from the strain of care-giving as the disease progresses. The strain can easily become intolerable for spouses trying to cope all alone at home with an Alzheimer&#8217;s sufferer and they themselves can have a physical or mental breakdown.

There should be no shame or guilt in seeking respite care from a professional home care agency. People who are not trained professionals often find it a strain to be caregivers, and should not feel that this makes them a bad or unloving partner or child. By turning to outside resources, a family can delay having to place Alzheimer&#8217;s sufferers in a long-term-care facility and, instead, keep them in the comfort of their own home.

Interim Health-Care has formed a strategic partnership with the Alzheimer&#8217;s Foundation of America (AFA) to support AFA&#8217;s goals related to dementia care professionals, including:

Raise the level of professional care provided to individuals who are suffering from Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and dementia;

Support professionals as they support those in need by providing practical training;

Set standards of excellence through the AFA qualification program;

Offer networking and advocacy opportunities.

A leader in the home health-care industry, recognizes the special needs of Alzheimer&#8217;s and dementia patients and their families. Creating an Alzheimer&#8217;s- and dementia-friendly and safe environment is an important step in making it possible for people to remain at home much longer and further into the disease.
