World oil demand growth in 2010 remained unchanged at 1.0 million barrels per day. Global oil demand is projected to continue throughout 2011, perhaps at a slow pace. It is predicted that the recovery in oil demand will take place in all the quarters, though with more strength in the second half of the year. The expected growth in oil demand next year comes as a result of not only the increased economic activity, but also from the low base in oil demand in 2009 and 2010. The bulk of the oil demand growth will take place in the non-OECD, mainly China, India the Middle East and Latin America.

On the product side, the demand for the industrial fuel will be strong as a result of continuing economic recovery. In the OECD, US oil demand is expected to be more than current year&#8217;s demands as the country continues to recover from the worst financial crisis. The middle east is having the proved reserve to the extent of 56% amounting to 754 Trillion cubic meters followed by Europe and Eurasia with 136 Trillion cubic meters of oil reserve. With the acceleration in the economic growth and the competition among various nations to be I the forefront with GDP growth and providing social security to the population, the oil demands is bound to grow in the days to come. But it is high time that we focus on the alternative energy sources for sustained and environmental friendly growth.
