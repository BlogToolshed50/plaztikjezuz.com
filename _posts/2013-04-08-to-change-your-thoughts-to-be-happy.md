Now this is a question that we have all pondered at one time or another in our life. Are we willing to look at ourselves and determine if we need a change? Or are we willing to just trudge along as we are &#8211; unfulfilled ?

Do we hold on to our negative thoughts? Do we hold grudges? Do we want to seek revenge for those who have hurt or shamed us?

I bet that most of us at some point in our lifetime would have said &#8220;Yes&#8221; to the above. But I ask you &#8211; &#8220;What did it gain you?&#8221; Did you really feel better by holding on to those negative thoughts?

I would also bet that most of you, if you truly listened to your heart, would say &#8220;No&#8221;.

Negative thoughts and emotions only make us feel bad. There is no happiness or smiling faces when we have those thoughts. No joy in our hearts. Is this what we really want out of life?

We must be willing to release our old, negative thoughts and beliefs. They are only thoughts that stand in our way of true happiness and joy. Some will say that is easier said than done. Well it is. We are only asking you to REPLACE your negative thoughts with positive ones. Positive thoughts that will give you peace, happiness and fulfillment. When you put all your attention on your positive thoughts, your negative thoughts will lose their focus and value. You don&#8217;t necessarily have to give up being hurt or mad at a particular situation or person immediately (this will come eventually), but start to appreciate what you have in life instead.

Appreciation and gratitude are our emotional healers. Grateful thoughts can be very simple as; your home which provides you with warmth and shelter, friends that make you laugh, family who are there for you in times of sorrow or need, pets that just give you unconditional love, jobs that provide you with income, a beautiful day outside that makes you want to enjoy nature or your car that gets you to work everyday. It is amazing at how many things we take for granted that we do not notice to appreciate. When you deliberately plant good thoughts, your entire energy is uplifted. Why? Because when you focus on good thoughts, that is what you will attract in your life. So when those negative thoughts pop up, don&#8217;t give them any attention. Laugh them off and immediately replace them with ANY good thoughts at that time.

If you were to appreciate or express gratitude of something that happened to you at least ONCE A DAY for at least 30 days, you would be amazed at how your life could change. Take it a step further and write it down every night before you go to bed. In 30 days, you will be surprised at what you&#8217;ll come to know about yourself and like as well. You may even want to explore a 90 day personal development program that will change your life not just for today &#8211; but forever. For me, this discovery enabled me to quit my job and enter into an in-home business adventure that is providing me with financial wealth and happiness. It may open the same doors for you.

So, are you willing to let go and BE HAPPY? Try it &#8211; you might like it.
