Why is it important to teach personal mastery to your children? 

Our children nowadays are the next generation. They would be facing a future that could hold immense possibilities and opportunities. But even with this bright future waiting for them, there is also a sad future waiting, a future where uncertainties and materialism can be prevalent. How can we prepare our children to face this kind of future.

It is beneficial to teach children a new set of values and attitude that would be good for the family. Helping children develop personal mastery in early age will help them have a mindset and habits that could be an instrument for their success in the future. 

The recently discovered personal mastery would help an individual to develop skills and behavior that would help them deal with difficult circumstances. Personal mastery enables an individual to understand the strengths and weaknesses of other people and deal with their emotions. Aside from this, personal mastery encourages thinking outside the box and ability to take responsibility for their life. 

These attitudes would be very beneficial for our kids. Personal mastery can also help children develop confidence grounded on reality, different from arrogance, live life and inspire other people and the world.
