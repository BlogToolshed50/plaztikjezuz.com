So you’re thinking of having a cruise vacation. Almost anybody could have a cruise vacation, but it takes a lot of planning to get that fantastic cruise vacation.

Planning starts months before your actual vacation date. So how do you start planning for you first cruise? You might have to ask yourselves first what made you decide to take a cruise vacation instead.

Is it because you have read about great cruise vacations over the web or some magazines, envied some friends or relatives who recently went on one or missed the all the fun you had when you last had went on a cruise vacation?

For first time cruisers, you may want to ask advise from friends and family. You’ll find out they’ll be more than glad to help you plan ahead. That’s because planning could also be so much fun.

Lots of people would be too eager to provide you with ideas on what to do, where to go and how to get some discounted rates. First time cruisers usually approach travel agencies to have their cruise vacations arranged.

However, before you start browsing the internet for the best travel agency, you may want to consult the rest of your companions first for the basic details of the trip. First consider whom you are going with.

Are you going out with your whole family?
  
Will you be going out with a partner or with a group of highly adventurous friends?

The type of companions you’ll be going would determine a lot about the rest of your cruise details. Most cruise ships welcome all age groups, from toddlers to great grandparents. There are also ships that cater to adults only.

Next thing to be considered would be your budget. Are you willing to mortgage your house and car to get enough finances for the trip? In getting a cruise vacation, there are no maximum to the budget.

You may only be able to cut down costs by shopping around first before finally deciding. You could also save a lot by having more than just two persons per cabin or booking six months in advance. A “mainstream” cruise line could average $500 a week on a minimum.

Do you want to get that cabin with a balcony? That would be more expensive than getting just a cabin with a small window or port hole. However, if you’re going on a honeymoon, you might consider that room which features a veranda.

The budget largely depends on how long are you planning to go on a cruise trip. Also, the length of your trip gives you the possibilities on where you might be able to go to. A week-long cruise trip would get you to the Carribean or to Europe.

More than seven days, you’d be able to plan a cruise vacation to any of the seven continents.

However, if you’re on a strict schedule, and possible answers to a tight budget, a long weekend off to the Bahamas and Mexico would be great. There are also “cruise-to-nowhere” trips. Your ship would just sail out into the ocean.

You won’t get anywhere though, but at least, you’d be able to get the hang of how it is to go into a cruise trip.

Next question to be dealt with is the time and place of the vacation. When and where would you like to go on a cruise. Cruise trips are relatively cheaper during the fall or spring, when most kids are in school.

Some places like Alaska or North of Europe are only available in specific months, but most ships cruise all the year round in most places like the Caribbean, Mediterranean or Hawaii.

The earth is covered with more water, so there should be a lot of available cruise destinations for you to choose from. Just keep in mind that different locations have its own special climate and you would have to research prior to going on a vacation to be prepared for any difference from what you have at home.

Then you would have to decide on the things you would like to do while on cruise. There are numerous of activities available on-board. Also, cruise ships, like in European cruises, dock in ports that would allow you to tour the city.

Pacific and Caribbean cruises on the other hand would give you the opportunity to explore the different islands. And of course, there are a lot of shore activities that you’d be able to do, like scuba diving.

You might want to get a general idea of what you’d like to do. Some cruise ships may have only limited or specific available excursions.

There are a lot of things to be accounted for when going on a cruise vacation. But you’ll surely enjoy making all of these preparations, and a fantastic cruise vacation you’ll enjoy more.
