Self help hypnosis can help with everyday stress, overcoming insomnia, which is a state that derives from stress or medication that you may be taking for an existing health state; weight gain is yet another common problem in our society, which can be helped through hypnosis by cutting your appetite and thus, controlling your food intake significantly.

**Helpful Tips**

Before going into self help hypnosis try to attend at least one therapy session where you can experience how you should feel and the results that will derive from such therapies. While there are no side effects from hypnosis you may misjudge your therapy and practice and end up being frustrated, as you will see no results; therefore, it is important you educate yourself first before you apply hypnosis to yourself or follow qualified therapist until you are comfortable to practice it by yourself.
