Business continuity Management is assuming greater importance of late in view of the changing dynamics in the field of marketing and over all business aspects. As I read elsewhere, it is a whole of business approach that includes policies, standards and procedures for ensuring that the specified operations can be maintained or recovered in a timely fashion in case of any disruption. In fact, the business continuity plan also assumes significance to have a better business continuity management in any organization. It is a comprehensive written plan of action that lays down the procedures and systems that are necessary to have continuity in the business strategy.

The main and major ingredients of a sound and effective business continuity management are the Business impacts Analysis, Recovery Strategies and the Business continuity Plans. The Business impacts analysis helps identify and measure the loss of business process in the event of any disruption. The recovery Strategy sets out the Recovery Objectives and priorities basing on the business impact analysis and helps the business to recover on time in spite of the eventuality. Any business house should concentrate on these vital aspects to ensure the smooth running of the business and meet out any eventuality and challenge the ongoing and unexpected risks in the business.
