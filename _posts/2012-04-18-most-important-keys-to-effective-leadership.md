Trust and confidence in top leadership was the single most reliable predictor of employee satisfaction in an organization.
  
Effective communication by leadership in three critical areas was the key to winning organizational trust and confidence:
  
Helping employees understand the company&#8217;s overall business strategy.
  
Helping employees understand how they contribute to achieving key business objectives.
  
Sharing information with employees on both how the company is doing and how an employee&#8217;s own division is doing &#8211; relative to strategic business objectives.
  
So in a nutshell &#8212; you must be trustworthy and you have to be able to communicate a vision of where the organization needs to go. The next section, &#8220;Principles of Leadership&#8221;, ties in closely with this key concept.
  
Principles of Leadership
  
To help you be, know, and do; (U.S. Army, 1973) follow these eleven principles of leadership (later chapters in this guide expand on these and provide tools for implementing them):
  
Know yourself and seek self-improvement &#8211; In order to know yourself, you have to understand your be, know, and do, attributes. Seeking self-improvement means continually strengthening your attributes. This can be accomplished through self-study, formal classes, reflection, and interacting with others.
  
Be technically proficient &#8211; As a leader, you must know your job and have a solid familiarity with your employees&#8217; tasks.
  
Seek responsibility and take responsibility for your actions &#8211; Search for ways to guide your organization to new heights. And when things go wrong, they always do sooner or later &#8212; do not blame others. Analyze the situation, take corrective action, and move on to the next challenge.
  
Make sound and timely decisions &#8211; Use good problem solving, decision making, and planning tools.
  
Set the example &#8211; Be a good role model for your employees. They must not only hear what they are expected to do, but also see. We must become the change we want to see &#8211; Mahatma Gandhi
  
Know your people and look out for their well-being &#8211; Know human nature and the importance of sincerely caring for your workers.
  
Keep your workers informed &#8211; Know how to communicate with not only them, but also seniors and other key people.
  
Develop a sense of responsibility in your workers &#8211; Help to develop good character traits that will help them carry out their professional responsibilities.
  
Ensure that tasks are understood, supervised, and accomplished &#8211; Communication is the key to this responsibility.
  
Train as a team &#8211; Although many so called leaders call their organization, department, section, etc. a team; they are not really teams&#8230;they are just a group of people doing their jobs.
  
Use the full capabilities of your organization &#8211; By developing a team spirit, you will be able to employ your organization, department, section, etc. to its fullest capabilities.
  
Factors of leadership
  
There are four major factors in leadership:

Different people require different styles of leadership. For example, a new hire requires more supervision than an experienced employee. A person who lacks motivation requires a different approach than one with a high degree of motivation. You must know your people! The fundamental starting point is having a good understanding of human nature, such as needs, emotions, and motivation. You must come to know your employees&#8217; be, know, and do attributes.
