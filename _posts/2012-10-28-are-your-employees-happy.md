Why should an employer bother with the emotions of its employees? Who cares if an employee has a problem, feels sad or depressed, or is simply unhappy with their job? &#8220;They can go find a job they like if they aren&#8217;t happy here&#8221; is the least effective route for an employer who wants to have a productive and successful business because unhappy employees cost the company money. Disgruntled employees are unproductive, uncooperative, and untrustworthy.
  
But how can you tell if your employees are unhappy?

The first and most important thing a manager or boss can do is get to know his or her employees one on one. This may sound like an amazing feat for an employer of thousands, but there are ways and this is one of the least expensive and most cost effective practices available to ensure that conflicts remain small and few. Taking a moment in passing to say &#8220;hello&#8221; or even setting aside one day a week or month to &#8220;check in&#8221; with your people says &#8220;I care about you and want to hear what you have to say.&#8221;, and really, who wouldn&#8217;t feel valued under those circumstances.

Next, consider absenteeism. An unhappy employee is four times more likely to miss work than their satisfied counterparts. Not all absenteeism is an employee &#8220;playing hooky&#8221; either; sadness, depression, and dissatisfaction in the workplace can lead to lowered immune response, stress related injuries and diseases, and poor lifestyle choices such as alcohol and drug abuse. If you notice higher than usual absenteeism in a department, this is a distinct sign that something is wrong top down or that there is a mis-communication among coworkers.

Additionally, if productivity is low or the &#8220;energy&#8221; in a department or sector you can be sure there are one or more unhappy employees about. It is in a company&#8217;s best interest to get to the root of the problem sooner rather than later as these sorts of problems rarely &#8220;take care of themselves&#8221;

There are things to do if morale is low or you have a frustrated employee and many ways to increase the potential for workplace satisfaction. These are just a few of the easiest and most cost effective ways to facilitate satisfaction in your people; rewards for a job well done, recognition when someone has exceeded expectations, a varied employee benefits plan that offers more than the usual health benefits or retirement plan, and flexibility in scheduling.
