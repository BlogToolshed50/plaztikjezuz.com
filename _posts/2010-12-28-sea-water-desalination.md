Sea Water Desalination is the source that is attempted to get the pure drinking water in many nations where there is shortage of drinking water for human consumption. In countries where the seashore is adjoining the main land, they venture into this process to get adequate water for all the usage. It is done by reverse Osmosis process. The water is treated chemically to remove the excess salt and it is done by way of evaporation also to get the optimum level of Sodium content to make it acceptable for the human consumption and agriculture as well.
