When the whole world economy was affected due to the sub prime mortgage crisis I was wondering what it is meant by mortgage and why it should affect the economy. Scanning through certain banking articles I could understand that the mortgage refers to the creation of the charge over an asset.

Bankers create the charge to secure the property like house while advancing loan to the people. In case of failure to repay the loan availed the charge on the property is enforced and the recovery is made. There seems to be various types of mortgage transactions prevailing in various countries.

Normally the registered mortgage is found to be the most secured one and it ensures the creation of records in the office of the property registrars. The banker in whose favor the property is mortgaged is entitled to enforce the property and bring it to auction to recover them. Yet, another type of mortgage called equitable mortgage is also used in different countries where the registration of the charge created is not compulsory. This helps them avoid the expenditure. It is better that one understands the various underlying concepts of mortgage to avoid the complications at a latter date.
