We have choices in life. We can look for the lesson and beauty in every single thing that happens to us. Or we can go through life kicking and screaming about everything that has, is, could, or will happen to us. Life is meant to be a journey, something 
we learn from and grow from. It is meant to be a journey of self discovery and joy, but you have to choose.

Two sisters growing up in the same house. Their mother is an excellent seamstress and sews for many people in the town. She also make all of the clothes her two daughters wear which gives her great pride in dressing them in the latest fashions at a fraction of the cost. The mother loves seeing her 
daughters in her creations. Sewing for her daughters is an act of love for the mother.

One sister loves the fact that her mother sews her such beautiful clothes. She calls then her “designer” clothes. She feels the love and care that goes into each new garment. She feels so special putting on the new dresses and showing her friends.

The other sister hates the fact that her mother sews her clothes. She feels others will think they can’t afford store bought clothes. She hates being even slightly different than her friends even though it means she has nicer clothes. She is 
embarrassed and feels that if her mother really cared she would buy her clothes from the store.

Two sisters living under the same roof, experiencing the exact same circumstances in different ways. One has chosen to make one meaning out of it and the other, a totally different meaning. 

We have choices too. How will we see things in our lives, our businesses, relationships, our abundance or lack of it. What are we willing to do to see the positive side of the coin. More to the point, what are we willing to do to change how we see things?

Scientist have been studying vibrational frequencies of negative and positive emotions. There are instruments that can measure these frequencies. When we hold a negative though for more than 17 seconds our energy vibration goes down, and when we hold a 
positive thought for more than 17 seconds the vibration is at a higher frequency. 
Ever been around someone who was depressed and seeing the negative? We all have. They can literally drain our energy if we hang out with them. On the other hand, a positive person, can lift our spirits just being in the room with them. Is it 
any wonder that positive people attract good things and people into their lives? And the negative people seem to attract every negative thing to them. Every time you talk to them they have another poor me story. It’s their choice and yours too. What will you choose to make out of your life.

“It is never to late to become the person you were meant to be”
