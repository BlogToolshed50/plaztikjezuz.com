Downloading software online was never as easy as today. I see so many websites online from where you can download just about anything that you want. From MP3 songs to movies just about everything is available online. Personally speaking having a computer is no more of use without an Internet connection. Once I was on a business visit to a remote countryside, where I did not have any Internet connection. That was when I felt that without an Internet connection having a computer is absolutely of no use. I&#8217;m sure that most of you&#8217;re reading this article would agree to this. These days, I do most of my work online, and just about everything in the world is accessible through the Internet. A better business model in the world of Internet is to charge per use than one time sale. This is how most of the subscription websites thrive online these days. I&#8217;m planning to start a subscription website myself in the near future.
