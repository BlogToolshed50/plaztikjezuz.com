The very first thing you need to do is decide what it is you&#8217;re really doing when you create your website or publish your ezine. Is it a hobby or is it a business? The difference, respectively, is the absence or presence of a profit motive. If it&#8217;s a hobby, fine. Don&#8217;t try and turn a profit, just enjoy yourself and make just enough to cover your expenses if you can. But if it&#8217;s a business, understand that making a profit is non-negotiable. It&#8217;s the reason for your business&#8217;s existence. You will no doubt have several purposes. But the profit motive is key.

Do whatever it takes to crystallize your purposes. For some people, just thinking about it and making a mental decision is sufficient. For others, crystallization requires seeing it in black and white. If that&#8217;s you, write down your purposes. Again, though, if you&#8217;re running a business rather than indulging in a hobby, turning a profit must be on your list of purposes (unless, I suppose, you&#8217;re running a non-profit business but we&#8217;ll leave that aside for present purposes). Recognize that purpose for what it is. Embrace it. PURSUE it with a vengeance. It&#8217;s nothing to be ashamed or coy about. So long as you intend to do so, and actually do so, by legitimate, honest and ethical means, give yourself permission to aggressively chase a dollar. Why crystallize your purposes in this way? Because they&#8217;ll keep you on track when you&#8217;re confronted by the naysayers who&#8217;ll inevitably pop up in your porridge.
