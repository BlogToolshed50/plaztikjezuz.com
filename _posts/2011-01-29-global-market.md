When the health industry is found to become expensive and in the path of growth as many people around the world are becoming health conscious, the global pharmaceutical market has been on a declining growth trend since2003. This trend is largely driven by the increasing number of drugs going off &#8211; patent in major therapeutic categories, declining research and development activities, growing scrutiny of the value of the medicines and pricing levels. In 2009 the global pharmaceutical market had grown by 7.00% as found from the data. In fact, US was found to be the single largest market at $323.8 billion with a growth rate of 5.5% compared with last year.

Worldwide, pharmaceutical sales growth is expected at the level of four to six percent during 2010 indicating a declining trend. Products with sales of more than $142billion are expected to face generic competition in major markets over the next five years, reducing prescription drug spending by $80billion to $100 billion through 2014. The expected 5to 8% CAGR for prescription of the drugs over the next five years translate in to sales growth of nearly $300 billion. However, the demand spurt is expected in the US and European markets in the years to come to help arrest the declining trend in the pharmaceutical market.
