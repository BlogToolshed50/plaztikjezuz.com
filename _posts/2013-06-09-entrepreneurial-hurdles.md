I was thinking back to a time in my youth when I ran the 300 meter hurdles in track. I competed with many talented athletes, and I felt that I was only mediocre. I rarely placed, and I waited far too much of my training with crippling thoughts like: If I only had the long stride like she does; If I could barely skim the top of the hurdle to shed off a few more precious seconds like she does; If I had those awesome track shoes like she does, then I might actually place!&#8230;&#8230;

Then at an important &#8220;medal meet&#8221; something incredible happened. My competition never showed up! I stood at the starting line alone- just me and the finish line. An easy smile spread across my face as I realized that this one was in the bag! With all those crippling thoughts disposed of, I was able to focus on me and my goal- nothing else mattered. Not only did I win 1st place that day, I ran it at my fastest speed ever which was where the true victory lie.

I was thinking about that today as I was pondering my journey as an entrepreneur, and the many entrepreneurial &#8220;hurdles&#8221; I&#8217;ve ever so gracefully had to leap over. In the beginning of my network marketing business venture I had great dreams, vision, and purpose. I was inspired and driven and ready to make my dreams and vision a reality. Then those all too familiar thoughts began to creep back into my mind. Thoughts like: she is making six figures a year- why aren&#8217;t I? He has such great posture on the phone- why can&#8217;t I sound that good? She is bringing in new clients everyday- what am I doing wrong?

Now I understand that I can use my valuable life-lesson I learned with the hurdles. I understand that during those times when the thoughts start to surface I have lost sight of My goal! My vision! My purpose! All I need to do is take those crippling thoughts and flush them away. Once I free myself from their grasp I am ready to show up to the starting line. And now, an easy smile spreads across my face. I again realize that my success is in the bag! I can do this! And not only do I succeed and win in my business, I grow stronger, wiser, and better as an individual! That is where the true victory lie!

I like this quote by Mario Andretti (auto racer) &#8220;Circumstances may cause interruptions and delays, but never loose sight of your goal. Prepare yourself in every-way you can by increasing your knowledge and adding to your experience, so that you can make the most of opportunity when it occurs.&#8221;

Now I know from experience that my success as an entrepreneur is directly related to my personal growth as an individual. For me and many others, the key to keeping sight of our goals is to fill our minds and hearts with positive and uplifting training and support from other like-minded individuals. Fill it so full that the crippling thoughts can&#8217;t squeeze themselves in. I have been blessed to have hours upon hours of phenomenal personal development training from my leadership team in my business, and also from the amazing Ellie Drake and other Brave-heart Women. I am so grateful to be a part of this organization and I know that my business and me as an individual can only get better!

I want to leave you all with a quote from Muhammad Ali which I think would make a very appropriate ending: &#8220;Champions are made from something deep inside- a desire, a dream, and a vision.&#8221; I challenge you all to be Champions of your own Purpose!
