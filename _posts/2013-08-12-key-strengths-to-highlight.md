Performance appraisals, performance reviews, performance feedback &#8211; they all refer to the same process that is very much part and parcel of working in large organizations. That doesn&#8217;t mean that smaller companies do not conduct performance appraisals, but they tend to do it less formally.

Performance feedback is clearly a necessary evil, as it allows a company to reward and recognize its best employees to motivate them further. For employees who aren&#8217;t performing at optimum levels, it provides a structured way of working with the employees to raise their performance.

From an employee&#8217; perspective, it is thus critical to ensure that your performance appraisals capture the best of your work during the period under review. The performance appraisal form becomes a permanent record that will have an impact on your career not only in the same organization, but may also be used as reference if requested by a future employer.

Obviously the most important thing to include in your performance feedback is achievement of your business goals or metrics. List down the key metrics and provide supporting evidence on how you achieved those goals. Include also challenges or obstacles that you managed to overcome.

Regardless of the industry, company or role you&#8217;re in, incorporate the following 5 key strengths in your performance appraisals. There is great emphasis on these values as they form the foundation for a company&#8217;s corporate culture, and are critical for its survival and long-term growth.

Key Strength # 1: Focus on customer satisfaction &#8211; describe how you contribute to increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty for the company&#8217;s long-term growth.

Key Strength # 2: Teamwork and collaboration &#8211; highlight how you build lasting relationships with other teams and work collaboratively to achieve common goals.

Key Strength # 3: Open communications &#8211; emphasize your willingness to listen to new ideas, or to adopt alternative approaches

Key Strength # 4: Interpersonal skills &#8211; stress your ability to work with all levels within the organization.

Key Strength # 5: Adaptability to change &#8211; illustrate how you&#8217;re able to adapt in the face of constant changes in the organization or industry

High ratings in these areas will enhance your technical or functional expertise, and will make you a more valuable player within the organization.
