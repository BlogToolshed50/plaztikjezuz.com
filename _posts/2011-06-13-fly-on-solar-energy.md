The objective of using renewable energy in the aviation sector seems to become a reality when we come across the news that a flight has run on solar energy for 13 hours. The international flight from Payerne in Western Switzerland landed at Brussels airport after a 13 hour of flight energized by the solar cells. Though the speed was 10 times lesser than that of a commercial flight of modern days, the day may not be far-off to stabilize the speed.

The flight was operated with 12000 solar cells and could complete the mission successfully. In fact, the research continues to improve upon the system and to ensure that the solar operated flights are put in to commercial use to avoid the pollution and to reduce the cost of operation after proper system. More such attempts should be made to use the natural resources.
