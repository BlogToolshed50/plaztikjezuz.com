Gorgeous celebrities have to be that way, because their jobs depend on it. It&#8217;s a fact that the movie-going, television-watching public would rather look at beautiful people than unattractive people. Yet, not all of them are everyone&#8217;s &#8220;type.&#8221; So what makes them universally good-looking? Typically, pore-less skin, toned bodies, and&#8230;impossibly white teeth. Of these three things, white teeth are probably the easiest, and most realistic, element to adopt for themselves &#8212; whether it&#8217;s one job to look good or not.

Super white teeth are more accessible than ever, with the myriad of bleaching products on the market. It&#8217;s not necessary to go to the dentist to achieve the kind of smile that stops traffic, although the dentist will get it done faster. If you have the cash and want to spend it on teeth whitening, it is more effective to have it done at the dentist&#8217;s. But for those of us who don&#8217;t have movie-star-sized wallets, the drugstore will do just fine!

Don&#8217;t limit yourself to the gazillion whitening toothpastes out there. They are only marginally effective, and are more for maintenance, not removing stains that have been building up for years. If you would like to add a whitening toothpaste to your killer smile arsenal, ask your dentist for a recommendation. You don&#8217;t want a paste that&#8217;s too abrasive or will harm your teeth. What good are pearly whites if you&#8217;re going to have to trade them in for dentures before your time, because of a lousy toothpaste? Be safe.

There are teeth whitening kits available almost everywhere. Some of these contain a mouthpiece and peroxide gel, and others have conveniently combined that step and produced whitening strips &#8212; disposable after each use, and the gel&#8217;s already on them! Deciding between those types is a personal choice. Some might prefer rinsing out a mouthpiece each time to reuse, others may prefer to start fresh each time with new strips. The active ingredient is the same either way: peroxide. If you have a sensitivity to peroxide, talk to your dentist about alternatives. Realize also, that use of these products can make your teeth more sensitive, temporarily.

This is however only the beginning. Understand that there&#8217;s more than kits, pastes, and strips on the path to a bright smile. Teeth whitening is one piece of the puzzle; another is behavior. Do you put off your twice-a-year dental deep cleanings? If so, get on the phone and make an appointment, because those cleanings help get rid of built-up stains that could be standing in the way of the bright white you&#8217;re looking for. If you&#8217;re behind on visits, it will make it that much harder to whiten up.

Also, look at your consumption habits. How often do you have coffee, tea, red wine, liquid vitamin B? Do you smoke? If so, whitening teeth is going to be an uphill battle. Staining agents will sabotage your efforts, and if you&#8217;ve seen how much whitening kits can cost, you don&#8217;t want to jeopardize your progress. They&#8217;ll only work if you give them a chance. Much like exercise won&#8217;t do as much for you if don&#8217;t also change your diet, teeth whitening alone won&#8217;t give you a white smile &#8212; not while you&#8217;re staring down the bottom of a coffee cup.

A white smile is a very desirable thing to have, and while bleach works, it&#8217;s only half the work. Considering what a difference it can make in appearance, isn&#8217;t it worth trading a cup of java for a glass of milk, once and for all?
