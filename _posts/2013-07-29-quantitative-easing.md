Quantitative Easing is the financial tool used by many nations to combat the recent economic recession. As I could understand, it is making available easy money to the financial institutions like banks to lend more so that, the liquidity in the system improves. The stimulus that is given through such fiscal measures increase the consumer spending due to the investment in various sectors of the economy generating employment opportunities.

This quantitative easing is done through various monetary policies like easing the percentage of cash reserve ratio that is to be kept with the nation&#8217;s central banks. The relaxation in the statutory liquidity ratio to be kept with the regulator on the deposits with the banks also helps to increase the money circulation in the hands of the general public to stimulate the economy due to increased demand.

However, the economists caution that, such quantitative easing should be monitored properly and the timely withdrawal is a must arrest the inflation. If it is continued without proper monitoring, it may create a situation wherein, huge amount of money will be chasing very few goods, inflating the asset value and reducing the currency value.
