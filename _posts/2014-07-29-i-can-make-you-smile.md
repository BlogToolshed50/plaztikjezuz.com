I love hypnosis and know that it is totally amazing in its ease of use and applications. It is natural and has no nasty side effects at all. It is a state of relaxation and calmness, and makes you feel as if you&#8217;ve been on a mini-holiday or had a mental massage.

Hypnosis allows access to the inner workings of your mind, your subconscious mind, the part where instinctive and automatic thought patterns are stored. This in turn enables you to change such thought patterns and their associated feelings and actions quickly and easily. And let&#8217;s face it, all of our experiences, EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM, are affected by our thoughts and expectations. We create our own reality through our own thought processes, and the majority of these are instinctual, springing from our subconscious, unbidden by our conscious and logical mind.

Just think of the infinite possibilities which hypnosis provides for you&#8230;you can change how you think and how you feel and how you act with the help of hypnosis. You can overcome fears, anxieties and phobias; you can build inner confidence and super-charge your mind for success in EVERYTHING; you can change habits like smoking, nail-biting or over eating&#8230;you can do whatever you want to do with a little help from hypnosis. Doesn&#8217;t that make you smile? Hypnosis will make you very happy, once you learn to use it.

I said before that one thing I love about hypnosis is its ease of use. It is really simple and straightforward to learn to use hypnosis. You pass through hypnosis every night as you go to sleep. You already use hypnosis, even though you probably weren&#8217;t aware of this. You have a natural ability to drift into hypnosis; it &#8220;just happens&#8221; as you go to sleep. So all you need to learn is how to induce this state of relaxation intentionally, and this is easy to do, simply by listening to hypnosis downloads.

As you listen to your hypnosis download you will be guided into a wonderful state of relaxation, a state which feels totally peaceful and calm. Your muscles will relax and so too will your mind. When in hypnosis you will find it easy of focus on making whatever changes you wish to make, and easily visualize yourself as you want to be &#8211; and this will make you smile; this will make you very happy indeed.

I know that you will be happy, because whatever you imagine you will create, quickly and easily. You really do create your own reality, and so you may as well plan what you want to happen, don&#8217;t you think?
