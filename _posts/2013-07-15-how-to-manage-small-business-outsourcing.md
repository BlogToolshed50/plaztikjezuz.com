Business management is a challenging task In case of business process outsourcing (BPO) projects it is even more challenging, you need to consider issues like timing, cultural, communication differences, etc that exist between your team and the offshore team. It is important to take into account factors such as difference in time zone, cultural differences and various working styles of the offshore teams.
  
By following guidelines small businesses can achieve greater success in their outsourced projects.

Guidelines about Management &#8211; Offshore Outsourcing
  
The best way to manage offshore outsourcing for small businesses is to start right, by discussing exactly what you expect from the service provider, the manner in which the information will be handled, who will handle it and how it will be protected. Don&#8217;t hesitate to ask for credentials and backgrounds of projects done in the past.

Good Eye to look into the detail
  
It is crucial to ensure that the outsourcing contract covers all the relevant details that relate to security issues, quality control, and time schedule for delivery of duly completed work.

Proper use of Resources
  
You need to clearly understand how much workload the offshore service provider can handle and the qualification of the people working on your project.

Communication Gap
  
You should ideally be looking for a long-term business processing outsourcing relationship and need to make the outsourcing team feel like a partner and motivate them accordingly. It is important that you keep the communication channels open with the outsourcing service provider at all times and take into consideration their views and proposals.

A Core Management Team
  
A small management team needs to be selected within the small business and this team will constantly evaluate the performance of the outsourced team and the quality of their work. It is important that both the domestic team and the offshore outsourced team work in sync.

Face to Face Contact
  
There are some small business owners who feel that according to the need of the project an employee of the business may be sent to offshore outsourced company to address communication issues and oversee the critical stage of the project.

Standardized Processes
  
Create a process for any changes that may be made in the outsourced projects and designate a person or persons who will be in charge of this process. This would ensure clarity in any changes in the projects and avoid confusion.

Costs and Expenditure
  
While it is important to discuss costs and ensure that transparency exists in this aspect of the business process outsourcing, you would also need to anticipate some increase in costs from unexpected factors and situation such as travel expenses and training & you need to budget the cost accordingly.

Manage cultural issues
  
It is important that you mange the cultural issues that may arise between your own onshore team with the offshore team. This ensures both teams can work well for one common goal of completing the project.

Milestones and deadline should be fixed for every project
  
Milestones and timelines for your project gives proper accountability from the offshore team and any issues can be resolved in the early stage of the project itself.
