Prevention as the key 

People who have risks for pattern baldness cannot stop the condition but can slower the rate of hair loss through various treatments. But for those who are undergoing temporary hair loss, prevention can be the key to avoid total baldness in the long run. 

The following are some of the tips that can help prevent hair loss: 

1. Proper diet. 

Having a diet that is balanced is one of the major keys to prevent excessive hair loss. Eating foods that are nutritious especially for the hair can be an effective tool to fight against the signs of hair loss. People who are experiencing hair loss because they are under nourished should take time to make a diet plan which can provide sufficient nutrients not only for the hair but for the overall health as well. 

2. Developing good hair habits. 

Unhealthy hair habits such as improper handling of the hair can lead to excessive hair loss. People—especially those who have sensitive scalp—should ensure that they handle their hair gently especially when it&#8217;s wet. Proper handling to wet hair is very important because the hair is weaker when wet. If possible, opt for natural air drying methods instead of using electronic ones such as blower. 

3. Stick to one hairstyle for a longer period of time. 

This will really help you prevent hair loss because you are letting your hair undergo its normal growth cycle. If possible, try to avoid hairstyles that are tight like buns, ponytails, or braids because these put too much pressure on the scalp and hinder it from growing. 

4. Don’t twist, rub or pull your hair. 

People who experience hair loss are those who twist, rub, or pull their hair often. If it has become a habit, try to break it. You can do this by focusing on other things instead of putting too much pressure on your hair and on your scalp.
