    <p>We’ve all had the unfortunate experience of being convinced by a pushy salesperson to buy something we weren’t sure we wanted. You may have really wanted the product, but after being pushed into buying it, you don’t want it anymore. You either return it or you never patronize the store again.</p>

<p>Since you resent the experience, don’t recreate it for others when you are trying to sell. If you didn’t appreciate being pressured and disrespected, no one else will either. When trying to close a sale, you must always respect the opinions and thoughts of the buyer. If all you care about is your payoff, then you will drive customers away. They will be afraid to buy from you, thinking that you will always try and convince them to buy things they don’t want.</p>

<p>Here are some helpful tips to help you close a sale with class:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Be kind and considerate: Don’t try to fool the customer. You will get a lot further if you’re really trying to help them, instead of just helping yourself</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give them a direct request: You can let them know what you want them to do. Don’t be afraid to ask for the order or sale. The customer will know you are being honest if you tell them what you really want them to do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give them two choices: Explain that, on the one hand, if they buy the product, they will be receiving these benefits. Then explain that if they don’t buy, they will be losing out in certain ways. People like to have the pros and cons laid out for them. It helps them make a decision the smart way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give them plenty of room to think: Don’t pressure them. As I mentioned above, people resent purchases they were pressured into. Real persuasion doesn’t involve pushiness. The choice belongs to your customers, so let them make it.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We learn at a very early age how to persuade people to do what we want them to. Some of us learn it better than others, but EVERYONE can LEARN to use simple persuasion techniques to make their life better. Often, earning more, finding the perfect mate, being pushed around less, and being happier in life don’t have anything to do with you as a person. It has more to do with knowing a few simple rules of persuasion.</p>
