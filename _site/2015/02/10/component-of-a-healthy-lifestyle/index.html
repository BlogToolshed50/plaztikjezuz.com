    <p>According to Dr. Shaver, several lifestyle factors must be considered to benefit from a better night’s sleep. First, evaluate the sleep environment — ensure that your room is cool, dim and quiet. Reserve the bedroom for sleep — avoid bringing work to bed or watching television in the bedroom.</p>

<p>Next, allow enough time for sleep — on average, the National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recommends eight hours for adults. But, in the 2002 NSF “Sleep in America” poll, 39 percent of respondents said they were sleeping less than seven hours at night on weekdays. And most only slept 7.5 hours on the weekends.</p>

<p>Finally, ensure that each sleep partner is comfortable by finding a mattress that meets individual needs. According to the NSF, 91 percent of people say their sleep surface is important in helping them get a deep, restful night’s sleep. And 89 percent of those surveyed in 2002 agree that a better quality mattress provides a better night’s sleep.</p>

<p>One alternative to traditional innerspring mattresses is The Sleep Number Bed by Select Comfort. It allows individuals to adjust the bed to their ideal level of personal comfort — their Sleep Number. A Sleep Number is a number between zero and 100 that represents each individual’s ideal setting for mattress firmness, comfort and support. With dual-adjustable air chambers, sleep partners can independently adjust the firmness on their side of the Sleep Number bed without disrupting their partner’s desired comfort level.</p>

<p>Kevin Garnett, professional basketball player for the Minnesota Timberwolves, has recognized the importance of sleep on his overall performance as a professional athlete and has taken personal sleep comfort to a new level. In 2001, the 6-foot, 11-inch forward ordered a custom-made 9-foot by 9-foot, dual-adjustable Sleep Number bed from Select Comfort.</p>

<p>“The Sleep Number bed has helped me sleep through the night when my muscles ache after a hard workout,” says Garnett. “With a regular mattress you have to adjust your body to the bed. The Sleep Number bed allows you to adjust the bed to your body.”</p>

<p>In studies conducted at Stanford University and Duke University, participants fell asleep faster and experienced better quality, more restorative sleep on the Sleep Number bed than on a traditional innerspring mattress. Stanford University researchers also found that 87 percent of those who slept on the Sleep Number bed experienced a greater percentage of REM sleep with fewer disturbances. The Sleep Number bed also provides more proper spinal alignment and 93 percent of participants reported back pain relief.</p>
