  </header>

    <p>The topic might have been more true in olden days when ignorance was bliss. It is not as relevant with today’s society. Skepticism is a part of human nature and will always remain so. Suspicion and mistrust come either from lack of experience or from bad past experiences. It is often when something or someone fails to meet ones expectations or acts contrary to accepted belief that one develops a sense of suspicion or mistrust for all future activities.</p>

<p>Galileo, Copernicus proposed groundbreaking theories. What they said was totally contrary to the then prevailing belief. They were accused of heresy and mistreated. It is now we term them as experts who were simply ahead of their time. Today George Bush has declared war on Iraq, but without full support of the world. Being American President, he is supposed to be the most powerful man on earth. Even after clarifying his motives and goals, there are many theories and rumors about his real objectives of the war which range from US taking control of Iraq’s oil to taking control of the world.</p>

<p>If you take the field of journalism and news reporting, there is always a sense of mistrust in the minds of the people watching or reading the news. Very reputed and famous newspapers and channels have been accused and quite sometimes proved of giving biased reports and in a way influencing peoples beliefs. Politics has been time tested. There won’t be any country whose citizens believe their leaders and politicians are clean and god-men. No matter what happens in politics, people always try to know the background objectives of the politicians. This mistrust and suspicion comes from experiences through the ages and will no doubt remain in the future.</p>

<p>Similar things happen in the corporate business world. Enron, a multi billion dollar company 3-4 years back is now considered as a case study of how a business can collapse on falsely built ideals. The market experts who could not predict the Enron disaster are being chided by investors. The experts in lure of money manipulated papers and are now cooling their heels behind bars. In this scenario, common people start losing their faith in these big names. This has happened over the years everywhere.</p>

<p>It is because of misappropriations and bad deals by few people who give an entire industry a bad name. Talking about politicians, there are actually honest and morally upright guys who enter the field with a magnanimous thought of improving and uplifting society. Even their policies and decisions are taken apart by people to know what personal motives are hidden behind these honest faces. Even if an Olympic runner runs a superb race without any drugs, there are rumors thick and fast that banned steroids might be the case and so testing is necessary. One rotten mango spoils the whole lot or can we say- gives the whole lot a bad grade.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2013/06/09/entrepreneurial-hurdles/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Entrepreneurial Hurdles</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>I was thinking back to a time in my youth when I ran the 300 meter hurdles in track. I competed with many talented athletes, and I felt that I was only mediocre. I rarely placed, and I waited far too much of my training with crippling thoughts like: If I only had the long stride like she does; If I could barely skim the top of the hurdle to shed off a few more precious seconds like she does; If I had those awesome track shoes like she does, then I might actually place!……</p>

<p>Then at an important “medal meet” something incredible happened. My competition never showed up! I stood at the starting line alone- just me and the finish line. An easy smile spread across my face as I realized that this one was in the bag! With all those crippling thoughts disposed of, I was able to focus on me and my goal- nothing else mattered. Not only did I win 1st place that day, I ran it at my fastest speed ever which was where the true victory lie.</p>

<p>I was thinking about that today as I was pondering my journey as an entrepreneur, and the many entrepreneurial “hurdles” I’ve ever so gracefully had to leap over. In the beginning of my network marketing business venture I had great dreams, vision, and purpose. I was inspired and driven and ready to make my dreams and vision a reality. Then those all too familiar thoughts began to creep back into my mind. Thoughts like: she is making six figures a year- why aren’t I? He has such great posture on the phone- why can’t I sound that good? She is bringing in new clients everyday- what am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>Now I understand that I can use my valuable life-lesson I learned with the hurdles. I understand that during those times when the thoughts start to surface I have lost sight of My goal! My vision! My purpose! All I need to do is take those crippling thoughts and flush them away. Once I free myself from their grasp I am ready to show up to the starting line. And now, an easy smile spreads across my face. I again realize that my success is in the bag! I can do this! And not only do I succeed and win in my business, I grow stronger, wiser, and better as an individual! That is where the true victory lie!</p>

<p>I like this quote by Mario Andretti (auto racer) “Circumstances may cause interruptions and delays, but never loose sight of your goal. Prepare yourself in every-way you can by increasing your knowledge and adding to your experience, so that you can make the most of opportunity when it occurs.”</p>

<p>Now I know from experience that my success as an entrepreneur is directly related to my personal growth as an individual. For me and many others, the key to keeping sight of our goals is to fill our minds and hearts with positive and uplifting training and support from other like-minded individuals. Fill it so full that the crippling thoughts can’t squeeze themselves in. I have been blessed to have hours upon hours of phenomenal personal development training from my leadership team in my business, and also from the amazing Ellie Drake and other Brave-heart Women. I am so grateful to be a part of this organization and I know that my business and me as an individual can only get better!</p>

<p>I want to leave you all with a quote from Muhammad Ali which I think would make a very appropriate ending: “Champions are made from something deep inside- a desire, a dream, and a vision.” I challenge you all to be Champions of your own Purpose!</p>

  </header>

    <p>Innovation, power of innovation, creativity</p>

<p>It’s a talent that everyone has, yet they think they don’t. The power of innovation. If you’ve ever marveled at somebody’s creative prowess, guess what, you can create and innovate too. It just takes time. Everyone is born creative. The box of crayons in kindergarten were not limited to those who possessed potential; because the truth is, everybody has potential.</p>

<p>You know how long it took to learn to ride a bike or drive or to never commit the same mistake again? It’s the same with innovation. It takes a bit of practice and a lot of time before this mind function comes easily when called. This article will teach you a few tips on how to bring innovation into your life.</p>

<p>Don’t listen to what other people say. Follow the beat of your own drum. Allowing for the input of other people will only bring cacophony to the music you are trying to make. If you have an original idea, don’t waste your time and effort trying to make people understand. They won’t. And the help you will probably get comes in the form of negative feedback. If all those geniuses listened to their peers, we would probably still be living in the middle ages.</p>

<p>Spend time on it. I cannot stress that enough, although, please do not mistake this tip to tell you to quit your day job entirely. Do not. This involves some tricky time management but with a little discipline you’ll be able to squeeze both in.</p>

<p>Exercise. Take a walk. Run a mile or two. Send all those endorphins coursing through your veins. Exercising certainly clears and relaxes your mind and allows for anything to pop up.</p>

<p>Record your dreams. Aren’t some of them just the craziest things that your conscious mind would never have thought of? If you’ve had these dreams before, and I’m sure have, this only shows you the untapped innovative power you have lying within. So jot down those notes. Those dreams may just create an innovative spark in you.</p>

<p>Find your own style. You can always tell a Van Gogh from a Matisse. You’ll know Hemingway wrote something by the choice of words on the paper. So it is the same with you. People will appreciate your innovation more because it is uniquely yours and that no one else would have thought of what you were thinking. That will let people see how valuable an asset you are.</p>

<p>Don’t hide behind nifty gadgets or tools. You don’t need the most expensive set of paints to produce a masterpiece. The same way with writing. You don’t need some expensive fountain pen and really smooth paper for a bestseller. In fact, J.K. Rowling wrote the first book of the Harry Potter Series on bits of tissue. So what if you’ve got an expensive SLR camera if you’re a crappy photographer? Who cares if you’ve got a laptop if you can’t write at all? The artist actually reduces the number of tools he has as he gets better at his craft: he knows what works and what doesn’t.</p>

<p>Nothing will work without passion. What wakes you up in the mornings? What keeps the flame burning? What is the one thing that you’ll die if you don’t do? Sometimes people with talent are overtaken by the people who want it more. Think the hare and the tortoise. Ellen Degeneres once said that if you’re not doing something that you want to do, then you don’t really want to do it. And that’s true. Sometimes you just want something so bad you become a virtual unstoppable. And that is passion. Passion will keep you going.</p>

<p>Don’t worry about inspiration. You can’t force it; inspiration hits when you least expect it to, for those unpredictable yet inevitable moments you should prepare. An idea could strike you on the subway, yet alas, you poor unfortunate soul; you have no sheet of paper to scribble down a thought that could change the world. Avoid these disasters. Have a pen and paper within your arm’s reach at all times.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Organizations around the world has been realizing the cultural diversity within organization is not a negative aspect, rather can facilitate organizational stalk for glory (Papers4you.com, 2006). However it is not an easy task to manage employees with different cultural backgrounds. Nevertheless there are many policy guidelines that can make task easy.</p>

<p>On a broader perspective, cultural diversity can be manage through communicating (creating awareness among all employees about diverse values of peers through communication), cultivating ( facilitating acknowledgment, support and encouragement of any employee’ success by all other workers), and capitalizing (linking diversity to every business process and strategy such as succession planning, re-engineering, employee development, performance management and review, and reward systems) strategies.</p>

<p>There are many different innovative ways that organizations have adopted to manage diversity. A small manufacturer of jewelery and accessories in California comprised of modest workforce is composition of Third World immigrants from Cambodia, China, El Salvador, Ethiopia, India, Laos, Mexico, Thailand, Tibet Vietnam and other nations. To acknowledge importance of their cultural association, at least 10-12 different flags are always hanged from the ceiling of its main production facility which represents the countries of origin of the employees. The owner’s view point is ‘I would like for this to be a little United Nations everybody getting along and appreciating each other’s culture instead of just tolerating it’.</p>

<p>If cultural diversity can be managed effectively, there is a potential to use diverse workforce for organizational benefits. Cox and Balke asserts that multi-culturism is directly linked to organizational success as Effectively managed multi culture companies have cost effective competitive edge. It helps in promoting minority friendly reputation among prospective employees. Diverse cultural corporations help to get better customers which has a variety of people. Diverse group of employees are perceived to be more creative and efficient in problem solving as compared to homogeneous group. Ability to manage cultural diversity increases adaptability and flexibility of an organization to environmental changes.</p>

<p>Many organizational examples can be taken in this regard. In Australia, for instance, Hotel in Sydney has unique edge that staff members in direct guest contact areas speak a total of 34 different languages. Similarly Qantas Flight Catering has sixty-six nationalities on staff, with various overseas-born chefs. So dedicated diverse ‘ethnic’ kitchens gave Qantas a huge competitive edge that offers food based on customer’s ethnic taste and requirements. Moreover Don’s Small goods through literacy, language and cultural trainings increased cross-cultural communication and increased profits while lowering costs at the same time. Similarly The Cheesecake Factory had put special effort to understand Japanese quality and packaging culture as Asian employees assist management to understand Asian tastes so that they can target exports to Asia</p>

<p>Hence the discussion suggests that it is imperative to realize that cultural diversity should be taken as a tool for better organizational progress rather than a managerial problem and if effectively managed, it can be a key to gain competitive edge and success</p>

  </header>

    <p>If you suffer from bladder control problems there are many options you can choose that can help you with your condition. One of the healthiest ways to restore function to your bladder is through Kegal exercises which are exercises that strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. These are the muscles that support your vagina, urethra, and bladder which is where your body stores urine. The body then sends the urine out of your body through the urethra.</p>

<p>It has been proven that strengthening your pelvic floor muscles will lower the possibility and even help prevent stress incontinence. To define incontinence it is the frequent or severe leaking of urine from the bladder. Sometimes this leaking can be caused by laughing, sneezing, coughing, or physical activity and is still referred to as incontinence.</p>

<p>Bladder muscles are commonly weakened by frequent heavy lifting over time, the loss of the female hormone estrogen after menopause, being extremely obese and recurrent urinary tract infections.</p>

<p>You can begin by starting and stopping the flow of urine while you are urinating. Doing this will help you use the muscles and familiarize you with them. When you aren’t urinating you can tighten the muscles and hold it for five to ten seconds about twenty times while increasing the repetitions gradually over time. Make sure you relax the muscles for equal amounts of time.</p>

<p>The great thing about Kegal exercises is that they are so convenient and easy to do that you can literally perform them anywhere, anytime. It is impossible for anyone to see that you are doing them, and the fast results will be encouraging. Even when you have achieved the level of control you were looking for you should still perform the exercises regularly to keep the muscles strong.</p>

<p>You should check your personal technique in the mirror every now and then to make sure that you aren’t using your stomach or buttock muscles by placing your hand on your stomach or buttocks as you tighten. If you are doing the exercise correctly you shouldn’t feel your stomach or buttocks tighten. You should see results within three or four weeks.</p>

<p>The women who are over the age of fifty and are experiencing bladder control problems can talk to their doctors about using an estrogen cream. An estrogen cream combined with Kegal exercised will greatly improve the strengthening of the muscles that are around the bladder and vagina.</p>

<p>If Kegal exercises alone aren’t effective you can combine them with other treatments such as medications that can help strengthen the bladder muscles as well as lower the urge to urinate.</p>

  </header>

    <p>All parents want their children to succeed. But knowing how to help them make smart choices and avoid pitfalls isn’t always easy.</p>

<p>Parents play a central, but not exclusive, role in shaping the lives of their children and teenagers. Extensive research shows that parents are more influential in their child’s lives than anyone else, shaping their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Yet parents are neither the only influences nor the only ones with responsibility. Peers, other adults, genetics, the media, and various other sources also play important roles.</p>

<p>Ideally, all these influences can work together with parents to promote young people’s healthy development.</p>

<p>Some Ways Parents Affect Children and Adolescents:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Parental relationships and monitoring demonstrate to young people that parents are sources of support and security, which help adolescents as they form their individual identities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Supportive, yet challenging, parental relationships are important for adolescents to find school more interesting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>High-quality family interactions have an effect on the quality of adolescent friendships. Parental warmth toward children helps children develop socially, and it helps kids be more well-liked by their peers.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>As infants turn into children and children become adolescents, they begin to spend more unsupervised time with their friends and have increased exposure to sources of influence and information outside of their family, such as media and school—influences that parents often view as harmful to their children.</p>

<p>However, the importance of parents does not diminish as children age. While adolescents may go to their peers more often than their parents for advice, they still choose to go to their parents in time of real need or while making serious decisions.</p>

<p>Parents’ Influence during Adolescence</p>

<p>Discussions about adolescent behavior often focus on negative actions, such as delinquency or early sexual behavior. One researcher said that this focus “treats successful adolescents and young adults as escape artists who manage to dodge the hazards of growing up, rather than focusing on the ways that young people acquire and master skills, construct positive identities, and learn how to negotiate social roles simultaneously in the youth culture and adult world.”</p>

<p>There are several ways that parents and parenting affect adolescents’ positive and negative behaviors. For example, family cohesion and having strong attachments to parents help kids make better decisions about which friends they choose.</p>

<p>Ways Parents Can Help Encourage Good Decision-Making:</p>

<p>• Monitor their behavior</p>

<p>• Spend time together</p>

<p>• Pay attention to their friends which in turn help the children to choose their type of friends</p>

<p>• Communicate and be involved</p>

    <p>What is it you want out of life? Once you decide what it is you want to do and where you want to be, you then must realize what you have to do to change your thinking to achieve these desires. When we were babies, we knew exactly what we wanted. We cried loudly with no inhibitions holding back until we got what we wanted. As we got older, we were clear about what we wanted and headed straight toward it with no fear. Along the way, we would hear someone say, don’t do this or that and as we got older the negative words would be more intense. As we go through our lives, we somehow get stuck trying to figure out what other people want us to do. As a result we now do a lot of things we don’t want to do but what pleases others.</p>

<p>So how do we reclaim ourselves and our true desires? How do we get back what we really want with no fear, shame or inhibitions? How do we reconnect with our real passion. We start on the smallest level by honoring our preferences in every situation, no matter how large or small. Don’t think of them as petty, they might be inconsequential to someone else, but they are not to you. To renown your power and get what you really want out of life, you will have to stop saying,” I don’t know, I don’t care, It doesn’t matter to me. When you are confronted with a choice, act as if you have a preference. Ask yourself, “if I did know,what would it be? If I did care, which would I prefer? If it did matter, what would I rather do.</p>

<p>Not being clear about what you want and making other peoples needs and desires more important than your own is simply a habit. You can break it by practicing the opposite habit. To be successful in life, you have to decide where you want to go by clarifying your vision through goal settings affirmations and visualization and start moving in the right direction. One of the easiest ways to do this is to make a list of possessions you want to acquire. Close your eyes and visualize how it feels to already have them. What it would be like to have financial independence and live the life you have always dreamed of. There are people who will try to talk you out of your dreams. They will try to bring you down to their level. These people are called dream-stealer. Don’t listen to them. Believe in yourself, whether you call it self-esteem or self confidence it is a deep seated belief that you have what it takes.</p>

<p>My journey started the day I stepped onto the path of being an entrepreneur. I made a strong commitment to do whatever it took to forge ahead. Believing in myself and knowing that the mistakes I made along the way only made me stronger. There are three things that will help you be successful and they are activity, commitment, and self-esteem. Follow your intentions and everything will start to fall into place.</p>
