    <p>Performance appraisals, performance reviews, performance feedback – they all refer to the same process that is very much part and parcel of working in large organizations. That doesn’t mean that smaller companies do not conduct performance appraisals, but they tend to do it less formally.</p>

<p>Performance feedback is clearly a necessary evil, as it allows a company to reward and recognize its best employees to motivate them further. For employees who aren’t performing at optimum levels, it provides a structured way of working with the employees to raise their performance.</p>

<p>From an employee’ perspective, it is thus critical to ensure that your performance appraisals capture the best of your work during the period under review. The performance appraisal form becomes a permanent record that will have an impact on your career not only in the same organization, but may also be used as reference if requested by a future employer.</p>

<p>Obviously the most important thing to include in your performance feedback is achievement of your business goals or metrics. List down the key metrics and provide supporting evidence on how you achieved those goals. Include also challenges or obstacles that you managed to overcome.</p>

<p>Regardless of the industry, company or role you’re in, incorporate the following 5 key strengths in your performance appraisals. There is great emphasis on these values as they form the foundation for a company’s corporate culture, and are critical for its survival and long-term growth.</p>

<p>Key Strength # 1: Focus on customer satisfaction – describe how you contribute to increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty for the company’s long-term growth.</p>

<p>Key Strength # 2: Teamwork and collaboration – highlight how you build lasting relationships with other teams and work collaboratively to achieve common goals.</p>

<p>Key Strength # 3: Open communications – emphasize your willingness to listen to new ideas, or to adopt alternative approaches</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Key Strength # 4: Interpersonal skills – stress your ability to work with all levels within the organization.</p>

<p>Key Strength # 5: Adaptability to change – illustrate how you’re able to adapt in the face of constant changes in the organization or industry</p>

<p>High ratings in these areas will enhance your technical or functional expertise, and will make you a more valuable player within the organization.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Every now and then we come across news that life is in existence outside the earth.Many in fact bring out the information that they have sighted objects which are believed to be from elsewhere from different planets and much more.All these vouch for the possibility of the presence of aliens out side the earth.However the astronomers are of the view that even if such lives exist,such entities may not be intelligent or multi-cellular.The institute of astronomy in Cambridge has come out with the observation that over the past few decades the scientists have slowly become more open to the idea that life exists elsewhere in the universe too.</p>

<p>According to scientists, the technology has in fact enabled the astronomers to find more about the universe and the invention of radio telescope has helped them to explore more.The invention of the molecules which is the basic precursors of life, was made possible through the radio telescopes.Contrary to the belief in the past that planets around the stars are a rare phenomena,the present day astronomers are of the view that,planets are common and they are present around the binary stars.We can only hope that such lives in the universe will compliment to our efforts for the progress of the lives duly keeping in mind the healthy survival of the universe as a whole.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Quantitative Easing is the financial tool used by many nations to combat the recent economic recession. As I could understand, it is making available easy money to the financial institutions like banks to lend more so that, the liquidity in the system improves. The stimulus that is given through such fiscal measures increase the consumer spending due to the investment in various sectors of the economy generating employment opportunities.</p>

<p>This quantitative easing is done through various monetary policies like easing the percentage of cash reserve ratio that is to be kept with the nation’s central banks. The relaxation in the statutory liquidity ratio to be kept with the regulator on the deposits with the banks also helps to increase the money circulation in the hands of the general public to stimulate the economy due to increased demand.</p>

<p>However, the economists caution that, such quantitative easing should be monitored properly and the timely withdrawal is a must arrest the inflation. If it is continued without proper monitoring, it may create a situation wherein, huge amount of money will be chasing very few goods, inflating the asset value and reducing the currency value.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Successful people typically have one thing in common and that is their way of thinking. A driving ambition and unwavering perseverance pushes those who enjoy success to chase their dream and that same wilful attitude allows them to catch that dream as soon as they have the chance. Successful people know that anything is possible. They see a new opportunity around every corner and know that they can enjoy the happiness and triumph they desire.</p>

<p>Buddha said that “a man is what he thinks all day long.” Success is determined by a person’s attitude and their outlook on life. A person who thinks positively will seem to sail through life trouble free, while those who think of failure see all sorts of obstacles in their path. Not everyone can enjoy magnificent wealth and an affluent lifestyle, but the majority of our population fails to reach even the potential they are capable of. Instead of forging ahead and working harder to reach our goals, we give up and force ourselves to be content with less than we desire.</p>

<p>Henry Ford summed up the power of attitude in a single sentence. “Those who think they can and those who think they can’t, they are both right.” With the right attitude and mindset, we can do the things we dream about. We all know that it is possible to do the impossible. We’ve all shocked ourselves, as well as others, at some point in each of our lives by allowing our minds and our mental perseverance to push us to do the seemingly impossible. When we focus on an attitude of success, the exceptional talents we each possess can reach their full potential and carry us to our goals. What you do and the achievements you attain is influenced greatly by the way you think.</p>

<p>Everyone has a dream. Whether you see your dreams become reality, enjoying success and prosperity, or you spend your life chasing those dreams, never seeing any real accomplishments, depends almost entirely on your attitude. So many people spend all their time and energy working towards their goals, but have a negative attitude. Their thoughts are directed by the problems in the world, not the possibilities. Constant fears of scarcity, poverty, and failure create obstacles in the path of their dreams and these negative barriers leave them stranded in an unsatisfying life.</p>

<p>So how, you may ask, can I adopt a positive attitude of success and live my dreams? It is as simple as changing your way of thought! While some people have a natural attitude of success and face every challenge with a conquering assertiveness, most of us have to make a conscience effort to think “I can” rather than “that’s impossible.” Don’t doubt your own abilities. Instead, push yourself forward and keep trying. Most of the time, our own negative thoughts and uncertainty in ourselves is the only thing really keeping us from a successful life.</p>

<p>Set goals for yourself and when you face challenges, offer yourself positive encouragement and spur yourself onward. A can-do attitude will make all things possible and will keep your head high when others would give up. When you reach your first goal, you will see a new boost of confidence in your abilities and it will soon be natural to enjoy success. Failure will no longer be your way of thinking.</p>

<p>It is important to never forget that a successful attitude incorporates selfless thinking as a way of life. To achieve true success, we must concentrate on improving life for all humanity, not our own lives alone. Wallace Wattles, author of The Science of Getting Rich, instructs us to direct our energy toward creativeness rather than competition. True success comes from the ability to serve others, not the ability to accumulate wealth, power, and fame.</p>

<p>With the right attitude and an anything’s possible outlook you can enjoy a truly successful life. By concentrating on what is best for everyone, as well as yourself, you can achieve ultimate satisfaction, both inside and out.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Business management is a challenging task In case of business process outsourcing (BPO) projects it is even more challenging, you need to consider issues like timing, cultural, communication differences, etc that exist between your team and the offshore team. It is important to take into account factors such as difference in time zone, cultural differences and various working styles of the offshore teams.</p>

<p>By following guidelines small businesses can achieve greater success in their outsourced projects.</p>

<p>Guidelines about Management – Offshore Outsourcing</p>

<p>The best way to manage offshore outsourcing for small businesses is to start right, by discussing exactly what you expect from the service provider, the manner in which the information will be handled, who will handle it and how it will be protected. Don’t hesitate to ask for credentials and backgrounds of projects done in the past.</p>

<p>Good Eye to look into the detail</p>

<p>It is crucial to ensure that the outsourcing contract covers all the relevant details that relate to security issues, quality control, and time schedule for delivery of duly completed work.</p>

<p>Proper use of Resources</p>

<p>You need to clearly understand how much workload the offshore service provider can handle and the qualification of the people working on your project.</p>

<p>Communication Gap</p>

<p>You should ideally be looking for a long-term business processing outsourcing relationship and need to make the outsourcing team feel like a partner and motivate them accordingly. It is important that you keep the communication channels open with the outsourcing service provider at all times and take into consideration their views and proposals.</p>

<p>A Core Management Team</p>

<p>A small management team needs to be selected within the small business and this team will constantly evaluate the performance of the outsourced team and the quality of their work. It is important that both the domestic team and the offshore outsourced team work in sync.</p>

<p>Face to Face Contact</p>

<p>There are some small business owners who feel that according to the need of the project an employee of the business may be sent to offshore outsourced company to address communication issues and oversee the critical stage of the project.</p>

<p>Standardized Processes</p>

<p>Create a process for any changes that may be made in the outsourced projects and designate a person or persons who will be in charge of this process. This would ensure clarity in any changes in the projects and avoid confusion.</p>

<p>Costs and Expenditure</p>

<p>While it is important to discuss costs and ensure that transparency exists in this aspect of the business process outsourcing, you would also need to anticipate some increase in costs from unexpected factors and situation such as travel expenses and training &amp; you need to budget the cost accordingly.</p>

<p>Manage cultural issues</p>

<p>It is important that you mange the cultural issues that may arise between your own onshore team with the offshore team. This ensures both teams can work well for one common goal of completing the project.</p>

<p>Milestones and deadline should be fixed for every project</p>

<p>Milestones and timelines for your project gives proper accountability from the offshore team and any issues can be resolved in the early stage of the project itself.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Just because it’s the thick of winter doesn’t mean you can’t plan your outdoor landscape now. That includes picking and designing your plans in conjunction with a new garden water fountain. An outdoor fountain can add different levels, light and motion, but to get the best results it’s always a good idea to plan ahead. Water Fountain Place’s fountain experts often get questions about which fountains would be best for a particular garden or other location. The answer ultimately depends on your personal preferences, but there are some basic practical guidelines to observe.</p>

<p>Electricity for Your Outdoor Fountain</p>

<p>Your first consideration is electricity. Modern outdoor fountains almost always work from a three-prong power supply. You must be able to run a waterproof electrical line to your fountain that nobody’s going to trip over, and that won’t ruin the look of your garden, deck and other space. If you’re considering a major landscaping change, you might want to add an all-weather outlet close to where you’d like to place your outdoor fountain. If you’d like to put your outdoor fountain somewhere that you can’t easily run a cord to, consider purchasing a solar garden fountain. You can place solar powered fountains anywhere the solar panel can catch direct sunlight.</p>

<p>Find a Level Space for Your Garden Fountain</p>

<p>Modern water fountains don’t usually need complicated plumbing only require a small amount of maintenance, but they’re not 100% painless (just 99%!). You need to find or build a level space large enough to contain the entire fountain and clearance on each side. One reason it’s good to think about this sort of thing in the off-season is that you may have to do some minor landscaping to get the ideal spot. When you pick a level location, consider the fact that you need to be able to reach the garden fountain’s cord, get through its basin and pump and once the season ends, winterize your fountain. Depending on the fountain this might require anything from an inch or two of clearance to a level walkway around most of its circumference.</p>

<p>Consider the Surrounding Colors</p>

<p>When it comes to picking your fountain, think of the surrounding colors. You can take two approaches here. First, you can pick a fountain based on your existing plants, flowers, lawns and stone work. Second, you can pick the fountain’s color freely, but plan to rearrange the space to suit it. This doesn’t mean you have to do major digging. In many cases, just planting new flowers, adding new or different stones or seeding a former gravel path area with new grass ca fine tune your outdoor space to match your preferred fountain perfectly. When in doubt, consider metallic and mirrored fountains, which go with most color schemes, or earth tones, which will also almost always match.</p>

<p>Make Your Outdoor Fountain Animal and Child Safe</p>

<p>Beyond look, convenience and maintenance considerations, remember to make your new garden fountain safe to be around. This article lists them last because they don’t affect the choice or placement of your fountain, but they actually come first on your list of priorities. Even if you don’t own children and pets, Water Fountain Place strongly recommends keeping your fountain water and basin clean using a non-toxic product. You never know who might stray into your garden, and in many areas owner liability is clearly established in the law. Fortunately, it’s easy to keep your fountain’s water clean; Water Fountain Place sells an enzyme based fountain protector that’s non-toxic to keep pets, kids and wildlife safe from accidental exposure</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2013/07/02/powerful-way-to-increase-staff-performance/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Powerful Way to Increase Staff Performance</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>To increase performance these days, some companies send their staff to motivational seminars. These seminars can get good results, but if they are mainly “motivational”, we often see the effects wear off in days or weeks.</p>

<p>Some companies put their staff through training programs to help them handle the details of their post and to relate better to their customers. These can also be quite beneficial.</p>

<p>And some businesses use rewards programs to increase staff productivity. These have varied workability, some work splendidly, others are not so effective.</p>

<p>In this article, you will be given a very simple way to increase the performance of the people who work for and with you. And as the title of the article indicates, it may possibly be the most powerful way to accomplish increases in staff output and effectiveness.</p>

<p>And here it is:</p>

<p>Acknowledge them when they’ve done something right!</p>

<p>People work for all kinds of reasons. We know the obvious ones. A not-so-obvious reason is to be recognized in some way for what they do. Especially when they do something right.</p>

<p>When somebody in your business does something right, LET THEM KNOW IT. Acknowledge them in some way.</p>

<p>Tell your secretary, “Thank you, Mary, for getting that report to me on time.”</p>

<p>Alice would love to hear that she’s been handling the switchboard exceptionally well the last few days.</p>

<p>Even the most seasoned salesperson will appreciate it when you shake his hand after a sale and say, “Bob, you handled that customer very professionally. Great job.”</p>

<p>Before you decide that this is too simple or that it just wouldn’t apply to your business, let’s look at an underlying principle at work here. People just simply appreciate acknowledgement or recognition. Don’t you? Do you not appreciate it when somebody sincerely acknowledges you for something you’ve done well?</p>

<p>Every group (whether it is a family or an organization) is built upon the willingness of the individuals composing it. You significantly increase that willingness when you acknowledge and recognize people for what they do.</p>

<p>This does not mean that you run around all day telling everyone you see how great and wonderful they are. We’re not talking about an airy-fairy or touchy-feely thing here. We are talking about a basic principle that is capable of increasing your staff’s willingness to produce and that willingness is actually your greatest capital.</p>

<p>Should you present year-ending or quarter-ending awards to your staff at a lavish dinner engagement? Sure.</p>

<p>Should you implement an incentive program that your staff agree with and will produce more to achieve? As long as it is viable for the business itself, absolutely.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t these types of programs recognize your staff in an appropriate way? Most certainly.</p>

<p>Those types of programs, however, are not the point of this article. The type of acknowledgement being discussed here is for the day-to-day running of things. When someone in your outfit does something well, say or do something that shows you appreciate that. Even if it’s a fast gesture or nod, it will communicate. Every effort you make on this will pay off.</p>

<p>I realize that some of you may have a hard time acknowledging your staff or expressing appreciation. I understand that. That is the province of another article. If you’re not comfortable acknowledging when others do things well, my suggestion is to implement this principle in small steps. A little here, a little there. I’m not patronizing here – a gradual approach to this will help you accomplish something that could be very valuable to your business.</p>

<p>Businesses perform much better when the people who make up the business are recognized on a day-to-day basis. They are more willing, more eager to do even the small things that are sometimes crucial to success.</p>

<p>You can and should get your staff applying this principle with each other. It will have a ripple effect.</p>

<p>“Alan, you handled that irate customer superbly. Thank you for rolling up your sleeves on that one.” Alan smiles and is more willing to roll up his sleeves the next time.</p>

<p>Does this principle have application outside of a business setting? Could it be used with friends and family? The answer is a resounding yes … but you already knew that.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading this article. I hope it enhances your business and personal life.</p>
