    <p>Many of us own car nowadays and the population of car owners is on the increase. In fact, only very few know the basic technology about the cars and the important aspects of maintaining the same. Continuous attention need to be given in the maintenance of a car while in use otherwise, the life of the same becomes short.</p>

<p>The main and fundamental aspect in maintaining a car is giving proper attention to the engine and the need to refresh it often. Here, comes the importance of proper attention to the radiators. Automative radiators in the car is the most important component which takes care of the cooling system. Excessive heat will lead to the damage of the engine and hence, to keep at under the cooling system is a must through the radiators.</p>

<p>During the summer it is a must that the radiator is maintained properly so that, the heat is taken away from the engine and the engine of the vehicle works better for a longer distance. If the system is under repair, the engine will become hot even during the freezing temperature condition and the vehicle will give trouble during the heavy traffic hours. As such, we should equip ourselves in attending to such vital parts of the car to ensure better efficiency and hassle free journey.</p>

  </header>

    <p>When the whole world economy was affected due to the sub prime mortgage crisis I was wondering what it is meant by mortgage and why it should affect the economy. Scanning through certain banking articles I could understand that the mortgage refers to the creation of the charge over an asset.</p>

<p>Bankers create the charge to secure the property like house while advancing loan to the people. In case of failure to repay the loan availed the charge on the property is enforced and the recovery is made. There seems to be various types of mortgage transactions prevailing in various countries.</p>

<p>Normally the registered mortgage is found to be the most secured one and it ensures the creation of records in the office of the property registrars. The banker in whose favor the property is mortgaged is entitled to enforce the property and bring it to auction to recover them. Yet, another type of mortgage called equitable mortgage is also used in different countries where the registration of the charge created is not compulsory. This helps them avoid the expenditure. It is better that one understands the various underlying concepts of mortgage to avoid the complications at a latter date.</p>

  </header>

    <p>When the health industry is found to become expensive and in the path of growth as many people around the world are becoming health conscious, the global pharmaceutical market has been on a declining growth trend since2003. This trend is largely driven by the increasing number of drugs going off – patent in major therapeutic categories, declining research and development activities, growing scrutiny of the value of the medicines and pricing levels. In 2009 the global pharmaceutical market had grown by 7.00% as found from the data. In fact, US was found to be the single largest market at $323.8 billion with a growth rate of 5.5% compared with last year.</p>

<p>Worldwide, pharmaceutical sales growth is expected at the level of four to six percent during 2010 indicating a declining trend. Products with sales of more than $142billion are expected to face generic competition in major markets over the next five years, reducing prescription drug spending by $80billion to $100 billion through 2014. The expected 5to 8% CAGR for prescription of the drugs over the next five years translate in to sales growth of nearly $300 billion. However, the demand spurt is expected in the US and European markets in the years to come to help arrest the declining trend in the pharmaceutical market.</p>

  </header>

    <p>It is something every one of should seriously think about and play the role expected of us to uproot the menace of corruption in this world. Of late, the data are alarming and the incidence of corruption is very much on the rise. Many countries have increased their level of corruption. Bribery and scandalous business is on the increase in many countries. The latest data I came across, Chad leads the list of corrupt nations. This country is adjoining the poorest nation Sudan as the study indicates. It is quite interesting to observe that the level of poverty is directly proportional to the level of corruption.</p>

<p>Also is a point of consideration that the level is very high in the nations were the dictatorship is prevalent for a longer period. Chad is an appropriate example for the same as it is under dictatorship for the past 19 years. Yet, another observation is that the countries that are getting foreign assistance in plenty are also in the list of most corrupt nations. It is paining to note that countries like Venezuela and Cambodia are in the top 10 list.</p>

<p>The world bank report as much as 5%($2.6 Trillion) of the global GDP is used for bribes and it is virtually stolen from the taxpayer’s money. Corruption leads to social economic effect in preventing foreign investments into a country for its development. In fact, nations like Canada and Japan are also cited in the report of Transparency international as the nations having corruption. In democratic countries the corruption by the bureaucracy is also found to be rampant. It is high time the rulers and that are ruled devote their attention to eliminate this evil from this world.</p>

Grey hair is an issue which most of us want to tackle to avoid the impression in others that we are old.

    <p>Downloading software online was never as easy as today. I see so many websites online from where you can download just about anything that you want. From MP3 songs to movies just about everything is available online. Personally speaking having a computer is no more of use without an Internet connection. Once I was on a business visit to a remote countryside, where I did not have any Internet connection. That was when I felt that without an Internet connection having a computer is absolutely of no use. I’m sure that most of you’re reading this article would agree to this. These days, I do most of my work online, and just about everything in the world is accessible through the Internet. A better business model in the world of Internet is to charge per use than one time sale. This is how most of the subscription websites thrive online these days. I’m planning to start a subscription website myself in the near future.</p>

    <p>Fitness is becoming the buzz word these days. There are just too many websites that are springing up each day about fitness and health. If this is a buzz word, then why not a post on my blog about this topic. A recent statistics show that an American family spends 150$s per year on fitness and good health related products. This is gradually increasing each year and hence the companies that deal with fitness products are planning for a great year ahead. In this current trend of economic slowdown, fitness until remains a pasture land and I suggest you put your money into this area if you are planning to in the near future.</p>

I had a wonderful Halloween party at my friend’s place, where I could meet so many people and get together. This year I found so many new costumes that the really scary.

    <p>Sea Water Desalination is the source that is attempted to get the pure drinking water in many nations where there is shortage of drinking water for human consumption. In countries where the seashore is adjoining the main land, they venture into this process to get adequate water for all the usage. It is done by reverse Osmosis process. The water is treated chemically to remove the excess salt and it is done by way of evaporation also to get the optimum level of Sodium content to make it acceptable for the human consumption and agriculture as well.</p>

  </header>

    <p>The financial crisis is affecting the globe to a greater extent and the entire world is reeling under the economic contraction. Many economists have come out with the various reasons for the present scenario. Some view the present banking regulations in various countries is not up to the mark to arrest the debacle. While many opined that the banks and other financial institutions had not insulated themselves with the needed risk management. I personally feel that, the financial institutions had not prepared with the buffer out of their profit to face the crisis.</p>

<p>Lack of international co ordination to the extent needed was also absent, leading to the present precarious condition. It is high time that the right risk management policy is put in to place by standardizing the norms at international level. Funding to the unproductive sector should have a cap and the regulator should monitor the movement very closely. The saving habit need to be inculcated in the minds of the citizens to meet out the eventuality.</p>
