  </header>

    <p>Happiness is one of the most commonly used words. We all say – the children look so happy. I am very happy today. You don’t look happy. Any reason? How to make a happy world? How to avoid sad feelings and feel happy? Which pill can help us? The discussion about happiness is endless. Does science give a common definition of happiness? General answers are available that say that happiness is a state when one feels good, elated , contented, good etc. Is happiness a life long gift or a n emotion experienced for a short time.</p>

<p>If I win a lottery, I become happy. As I spend all the money, I become unhappy again. When you call me a good person, I feel happy and when you curse me, I feel very unhappy. If I look at the dead body of my old friend, I feel unhappy and when I look at laughing faces of children I feel happy. We have no control. Outside forces and events control our emotions. We are all toys that have no free will. This is difficult to believe but true.</p>

<p>Let us find out what is not happiness. Low self-esteem, feelings of despondency, sadness, guilt, helplessness, frustration, low interest, uncertainty, and all such negative emotions are not happy emotions. They rather make us unhappy. Now let us talk of what is happiness? Feeling good, cheerful outlook, positive thoughts, winning attitudes, satisfied living, enjoyment, and all such emotions that make us feel good are happy feelings. Please view these wallpapers. Find out if they make your group of friends equally happy? It may be a learning experience for all of you. Is happiness same for all of us? If I give a certain amount to few people, some may become very happy and some may become angry and some will not care either way. Am I making myself clear? So happiness is not something that we feel in equal measure. I may be very happy when I watch the star lit night, but you may enjoy only the bright sunshine. So each one of us has his/her own happiness.</p>

<p>Some people are happy when they get a large amount of money, some when they can do lot of creative work, some when they can make others feel good and so on. All of us have our unique set of values and desires. We ourselves many times do not know about them. It become difficult therefore to know how to keep others happy and this ignorance causes most of inter personal problems. But these differences in our emotional reactions make us human beings; otherwise we are no different than animals.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2012/07/17/wonderful-neck-tie-jokes/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Wonderful Neck tie Jokes</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Here are some interesting tie jokes that shall make you laugh definitely.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A man gets a new neck tie for his birthday but within a few days he takes it back to the shop. The salesperson at the shop asked him what was wrong with it he replied “One end is longer than the other end”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A guy went into a restaurant lounge with his shirt open up at the collar and he was stopped by a bouncer who asked him to wear a neck tie in order to get into the restaurant.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The guy went to his car and looked around for a neck tie but then he found that he was not having one at that moment. He saw a set of jumper cables in the trunk so desperately he tied them around his neck and managed to tie a fair looking knot and let the ends dangle free.</p>

<p>He then returned back to the restaurant and again the bouncer looked at him carefully for a few minutes and said “Okay you can come in – just don’t start anything.”</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A neck tie said to the hat – “You just go on a head and I will hang around.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A man was crawling through a desert and soon he was approached by another man who was riding on a camel so when that rider came near to him this man whispered through his parched lips “Please…Can you give me water….”</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The rider replied him that “I am sorry because I don’t have any water with me but I could sell you a neck tie”.</p>

<p>The crawling man again whispered “Necktie? But I need water!”</p>

<p>Again the riding man said “There are only four dollars a piece”.</p>

<p>The man replied “I need water”.</p>

<p>“Okay two for just seven dollars”.</p>

<p>The thirsty man exclaimed “Please I need water”.</p>

<p>“I don’t have any water I have only ties” said the salesman and headed off into a distance.</p>

<p>By this time the man lost all track of time because he was crawling through the desert for many days. With clothes tattered and skin peeling under the restless sun he soon came near a restaurant. With his last breathe of strength he staggered to the door and confronted the head waiter.</p>

<p>The dying man again pleaded “Water.. Can I get… water”?</p>

<p>The waiter replied to him “I am sorry sir; our dress code requires a neck tie”.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2012/07/10/creating-healthy-sleep-habits-for-your-children/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Creating Healthy Sleep Habits for your Children</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>This interesting article addresses some of the key issues regarding healthy sleep habits. A careful reading of this material could make a big difference in how you think about healthy sleep habits to children. Healthy sleep habits for children are as significant as they are a necessary for health, proper growth and well-being.</p>

<p>Children, who get sufficient amount sleep every night function better throughout the day, are more alert, and their concentration, performance and memory are better than those who don’t sleep well. As well children with sleep problems are less likely to develop behavioral problems of any kind, moodiness, anxiety or depression.</p>

<p>The needs of sleep differ from child to child but school age children in general require in the area of nine to twelve hours of sleep per night. Consider these things if you are unsure whether or not your child is getting enough sleep every night.</p>

<p>• If he/she wakes up easily in the morning that is a good sign</p>

<p>• If he/she is wide awake, energetic and alert throughout the school day then the nighttime sleep is sufficient.</p>

<p>• If a child can fall asleep within a period of fifteen minutes to a half an hour than he or she is getting enough sleep</p>

<p>It is significant to explain to your child why getting enough sleep every night is significant, not only in terms of his/her health but also for performance in school and other activities such as sports, music, playtime, etc.</p>

<p>Bedtime Routines</p>

<p>Above all else developing and following a routine before bedtime is the number one tip to encourage good sleep habits in your child is to. A routine is good for children because children like predictability and a bedtime routine makes it easier for a kid to calm down after their busy day, crawl into bed and drift off to sleep.</p>

<p>A typical bedtime routine for a child should look something like this- a light snack, a relaxing bath, dry off and put on pajamas, wash face and brush teeth, read a bedtime story and then it’s good night and lights out.</p>

<p>Same Bedtime</p>

<p>Stick to the same bedtime every night. An occasional change in the bedtime routine, such as when grandparents visit or during a holiday weekend is one thing, but for the most part, a consistent routine is best.</p>

<p>Children Bedroom</p>

<p>Always make sure that a child’s room is at a comfortable temperature and that it is peaceful and quiet. Also many children do not want to be left in the total darkness while they sleep so getting a nightlight is a worthwhile purchase to make.</p>

<p>Stress</p>

<p>Stress can cause sleepless nights for children so always encourage your son or daughter to talk with you about any concerns or worries he or she is having, whether they be family problems, school related problems and so on.</p>

<p>You may not consider everything you just read to be crucial information about healthy sleep habits for your children. But don’t be surprised if you find yourself recalling and using this very information in the next few days.</p>

<p>Cut-off Time for Entertainment</p>

<p>It is an excellent idea to devise a specific cut-off time for entertainment for your child, in terms of television, video games, and the computer and so on. It is not a good idea to have a television or a computer in a child’s bedroom, as they can be easily distracted or tempted to play after they are told, “Enough for today.”</p>

<p>It is an even better idea to cease television, computer or videos an hour before bedtime in order to make the preparation for sleep a calm and relaxing experience. A child does not need anything stimulating before bedtime.</p>

<p>Sleep Disorders for Children</p>

<p>Children can suffer from sleep disorders just like people of any age can. Sleep apnea, insomnia, enuresis (bed wetting), bruxism (teeth grinding), asthma that is nocturnal in nature and nightmares can all occur in children.</p>

<p>You make a visit to the doctor to decide upon a course of action, the better, if your child is having problems with sleep the sooner.</p>

<p>Educate Your Child about Sleep</p>

<p>Try to make the whole sleep experience as positive and uplifting as can be. Encourage your child to learn how to fall asleep on his/her own and not to need to rely on you.</p>

<p>Research has proven that a child sleeping in a parent’s bed runs a risk of them suffocating or being strangled and also fosters dependence to an unhealthy extent. None of these things are as likely to happen when the child is alone in their own bed.</p>

<p>It is the kid who can be alone and fall asleep by him/herself who learns better how to cope with moments when he or she is awakened during the night. The only time that you might want to stay with your child until they fall asleep is if they are sick or extremely fearful.</p>

<p>Take time to consider the points presented above. What you learn may help you overcome your hesitation to take action.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2012/07/02/thinking-about-your-website/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Thinking about your website</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>We seen quite a lot of people discussing about how they should go around making a website and what a website needs to do to attract members, so I thought I’d give you my 2 cents.</p>

<p>*Breathe in now, deep breaths!*</p>

<p>A website is only going to be good if you have the time to put into it and are willing to put enough effort into it. Normally, a website is only as good as the amount of effort and time put into it. Blogging is a good way to start before you jump in and make a fully-fledged website. After that, you may want to start a forum and increase your knowledge of some server-side scripting languages (such as PHP) and increase your graphics designing skills.</p>

<p>When making a website, you have to consider the following things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why am I making it?</li>
</ul>

<p>For you and your friends to hang, as a source of earning money by displaying ads, to sell goods, to advertise your business or just a personal blog.</p>

<p>The design and content of the website will more or less revolve around this.</p>

<p>Then you must figure out what impression you want to give visitors of your site. Do you want them to gaze in awe at the special effects and cool graphics you have used but bare the consequence of slow loading times (especially for dial-up users). Do you want your visitors to find the site super easy to use and make it as user friendly as possible? Or, do you want your website to be just information – not very graphical but enjoy faster loading times?</p>

<p>From the many websites I have been involved in the website needs to be constructed around what it is intended for.</p>

<p>For example, there is no use in a website about your business being too flashy, which may result in some users having negative first impressions as they can’t do what they want to do with your website.</p>

<p>Now, for a website to be ‘popular’ you have to ask yourself:</p>

<p>“What am I giving my members/visitors?”</p>

<p>If the answer is “not a lot” the likelihood is that you won’t get that many visitors.</p>

<p>Even if you are offering something, it is no good if there are a hundred other websites offering the same or similar thing. Free Web Hosting can be used as a good example again.</p>

<p>There are lots of free hosts around.</p>

<p>But ask yourself, why did you choose R-FH?</p>

<p>The reason R-FH has become as successful as it has in such a short time is because we have modest post requirements. We realized that our competitors were making users post a lot to get their hosting accounts, so we made our requirement very low ~ a reason for people to choose us.</p>

<p>The more unique or original the thing you are offering, the more visitors you are likely to get.</p>

  </header>

    <p>A very important point to consider while designing a website is proper navigation. You must ensure that potential clients or customers are able to find the information they are looking for without too many clicks. As a quick rule of thumb, visitors to your site should be able to visit all your pages by using, at most, 3 clicks. This is also important when considering search engine optimization (SEO) because search engines will only spider (or index) pages that are 3 clicks deep into your site. Not only does proper navigation allow users to find information they are looking for, but it also allows search engines to spider (or index) the information they are looking for. This is essential if you want high quality search engine traffic directed to your website.</p>

<p>Different types of websites employ different navigation styles, so it is probably best to visit websites similar to your own to see which navigation structure they have chosen. The most common locations for your navigation menu are either on the left side of the page or at the top of the page. When internet users view a website, they do so using what is termed as a “Z scan”. As soon as a page loads, most people scan from the top-left, across to the top-right of the page, then down to the lower-left, and eventually across to the lower-right of the page. So, it makes the most sense to locate your navigation menu in the area where the user is going to first look.</p>

<p>Smaller sites usually only require a static menu on either the side or top of the page. However, website that contains 10 – 15 topics on different pages may require a drop-down menu. These menus may use DHTM, _JavaScript, or some other programming language. When the user’s mouse moves over a main topic category, boxes containing subcategories will drop-down, allowing the user to quickly find the information they are looking for. I f this type of menu is used, it is best to also include text-based navigation in another location on the page. Older browser versions may not support drop-down menus, and therefore a small percentage of people may not be able to navigate your website. Even more important though, is the fact that search engines will not be able to navigate and index your site if there is no text based navigation.</p>

<p>Another concern is accessibility by assistive technologies. For example, blind Internet users literally read the code of your page. Therefore, if a navigation menu is image based or uses image maps, alternate text must be used to allow the user to properly navigate the website. To make things easy, no matter what type of navigation I choose for a client’s website, I always include text-based navigation links at the bottom of every page to ensure that they are accessible to all Internet users and search engine spiders.</p>

<p>A Few Important Tips</p>

<p>•Plan your site navigation structure before designing your website to ensure that you are not forgetting any page links. It may be cumbersome to fix every page you have created because you a missing a link or two.</p>

<p>•The navigation menu must be clean-cut and uniform.</p>

<p>•Do not make the user scroll down the page to see the navigation menu.</p>

<p>•If you have too many links, use drop-down menus or create a site map.</p>

<p>•The navigation structure should be flexible enough to allow the inclusion of a additional links at a later date.</p>

<p>•Use short, clear and concise words in your links so your customers know exactly what type of information that page will contain.</p>

<p>•Make sure every page has a link back to your homepage. This can be achieved by providing a “Home” link in the navigation structure, and / or linking your logo image to the homepage.</p>

<p>•For larger sites, breadcrumb trails can be used to let the user know what section of the website they are in. For example, at the top of a certain page, the user would see:</p>

<p>“Home / Products / Widgets / Green Widgets”</p>

  </header>

    <p>Do you dislike having your picture taken because you always seem to come out looking hideous? Have you ever been on a date with someone whose online photo knocked you out but whose appearance in real life turned out to be a bit uninspiring? What’s the deal with pictures? While being photogenic just comes naturally to some people, there are a few things that anyone can do to look better in photos. Try out the tricks in this article and stop running for cover whenever the camera comes out.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Wear clothes with colors that suit you. Certain colors complement certain skin tones, while others tend to bring out the worst. Also take into consideration your hair color. You may have a feel for which colors you look best in, but if not, do some research (check out the external links below) and some trial-and-error.</li>
</ol>

<p>2.Determine your best angle. Beyond the obvious hiding of blemishes, finding the right angle for your face can be a bit more difficult. The best thing you can do is experiment using a digital camera so that you can immediately see the results of each pose. It will very quickly become obvious which angles are most flattering for you, and you can then use that angle as much as possible in the future. The classic model’s pose is to arrange your body 3/4 toward the camera with one foot in front of the other and one shoulder closer to the camera than the other.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Get rid of a double chin. Tilt your head down slightly and try to position yourself so that the camera is a little above your eye level. This will hide a double chin fairly effectively. You can also put one hand under your chin as though you’re resting your head on your hand (keep the thumb side of your hand out of the camera’s view, if possible). Don’t actually rest any weight on the hand, however, or you will push the skin into an unflattering position. Also try resting your tongue against the roof of your mouth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stick your neck out. One trick models often use is to present a 3/4 pose to the camera (turn your head so that 3/4 of it is exposed to the camera, as opposed to a full frontal shot) and then lift your neck and slightly tilt your head down, as though you are a turkey sticking its head out (without actually thrusting your chin out). This improves facial definition and helps ameliorate wrinkles and flabby skin.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Relax. Many people end up looking odd in photos because they freeze into odd facial expressions with a “say cheese” type of smile on their face. If you’re used to having bad pictures taken of yourself, you probably get nervous in front of the camera, and this can make things even worse.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>6.Smile with your eyes. Nothing projects happiness and beauty like smiling eyes: a happy, somewhat mischievous expression of the eyes. To achieve this effect, imagine that the camera is a person you have a crush on walking into the room. This will create wider open eyes and a relaxed smile. Chances are you unconsciously do this all the time; the trick is to be able to bring it out on demand, so practice the smiling eyes in front of a mirror.</p>
