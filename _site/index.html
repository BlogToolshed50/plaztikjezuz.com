  </header>

    <p>There are several compelling reasons why solar power is going to be massive over the next few years. Enrolling on a solar training course and why getting into this industry could be the best thing you ever do.</p>

<p>11 Reasons Why You Should Do It</p>

<p># Solar power is better for the environment than fossil fuels and once it reaches cost parity it will explode.</p>

<p># Solar power is growing in popularity and can be used to heat swimming pools, power cars, mobile phones, ipods and other small appliances.</p>

<p># Solar power is a renewable resource that will never run out.</p>

<p># The earth receives more energy from the sun in just one hour than the whole world uses in an entire year.</p>

<p># Shell Oil predicts that by 2040, 50% of the world’s energy will come from renewable sources such as solar power. Many major companies like Shell run their own solar training courses.</p>

<p># Two billion people in the world don’t have access to electricity. Solar power can solve this.</p>

<p># If you produce even more energy than you use, your utility company will buy it back from you.</p>

<p># Solar power is not affected by the supply and demand of fuel and is therefore not subjected to the ever-increasing price hikes.</p>

<p># By not using any fuel, solar panels do not add to the cost and problems of storage of radioactive waste or pollute the environment with the transportation of fuel.</p>

<p># Once your solar panels are installed, there is no more outlay! Its just savings. They are immediate and will last a lifetime.</p>

<p>The facts about solar power can’t be ignored! If you would like to get into this industry but don’t know how, please visit my blog for more information on solar training courses.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Most of us enjoy breathing lovely, fresh air. But for the many people who practical knowledge from allergic reactions and respiratory problems, fresh air is a requirement, not a pleasure. Luckily, property owners these days have a number of options that can help them take in more easily and perfectly in their houses.</p>

<p>Does Furnace Clean Indoor Air?</p>

<p>As far as home air filters go, the traditional furnace air filter isn’t designed to clean indoor air much at all. Actually, its only operate is to keep huge contaminants like hair and garbage from destructive the furnace motorized inflator. These huge contaminants are hardly ever the source of specific respiration problems. The benefit of conventional furnace filters is that they provide low-cost security to the Air conditioning air filters. But be careful, if you don’t modify these each 25 days or two, they will become blocked and gradually significantly decrease your furnace’s air supply. At the very least, blocked filters will create your air conditioner keep working more complicated and spend power. At more intense, it will cause “cycling,” which can damage the motorized inflator motor.</p>

<p>While classic furnace filters price less than also, there are many more indicate Home air filters for your furnace available that capture enough air particle matter to help people take in better. In common, the more expensive the limit, the better it will fresh inside air.</p>

<p>Electrostatic Home Air Filters</p>

<p>Dust insects are minute insects that look like a combination between Godzilla and a symbol (nasty creatures, as you can imagine) and the common house has an incredible number of them. Luckily, they are too small to see with the undressed eye. If you could see them, you’d probably feel forced to move out. While the insects can be very aggravating to the respiratory system, their dung and carcasses can be even more intense.</p>

<p>Generally, the better the home air filter is, the more insects and dirt mite trash is strained out of the air. The most amazing to use home Air filters electrostatic power to help capture about five periods as many contaminants as a conventional furnace filter. These filters have nasty or steel pieces that produce fixed power when the air strikes over them; in turn, the fixed power draws very small contaminants.</p>

<p>As with the primary filters, it is important to modify all filters consistently. Some filters are recyclable. With these, take them outside and hose them down once each 25 days or two. During the cold month’s season, use an in-depth washing laundry drain. Many people buy these filters thinking they will spend less, but after cleaning they twice decide it’s too much hassle and change back to disposables. The choice is yours, but creates sure you don’t allow unclean filters to stay in your furnace.</p>

<p>While this is a considerable sum of cash, it’s worth it if it gives you considerable respiration comfort to one or more individuals in your family. But, if the price is too extreme for you, convenient models can be bought for far less. Of course, small sized models fresh inside air in just one space (much like a screen ac calme down only one room).</p>

<p>Electronic air purifiers only need to be washed once a year or so because they incinerate the stuck dirt. The body system is well prepared to deal with respiration unclean air, so most people have no issue respiration regular family air insects and all. But if someone in your family is affected with bronchial asthma, serious respiratory disease, emphysema, allergic reactions or other breathing issues, you should examine ways to create the air in your house more mesh.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Sometimes dreams really can come true! May 8th – 11th, 2000, my daughter and I traveled to Disney World in Orlando, Florida, because of a dream my daughter, Amanda, has to make a difference in this world. Amanda (then a 6th grader) entered McDonald’s Millennium Dreamer contest and told them about her contributions to the humane society and her dream of making the world a better place for animals. Amanda’s dream is to help homeless pets find homes, and she makes this dream a reality by writing a newsletter and donating all her profits to the humane society. Her entry won her and a parent an all-expenses-paid trip to Disney World to meet with other Millennium Dreamers from all over the world. 2,000 kids were chosen in all–1,000 from the U.S., and 1,000 from 90 other countries. The kids’ accomplishments were recognized in an awards ceremony where Christopher Reeves and the CEO of McDonald’s corporation were among the key note speakers. Each congratulated the kids on all they have done and encouraged them to continue their efforts, emphasizing the fact that their contributions are the key to our future. One of the most exciting parts of the trip was trading pins with the kids from other countries. Amanda came home with pins from Germany, South Africa, Israel, Korea, U.K., and Indonesia, just to name a few. The kids were given free passes to all the theme parks and treated to firework shows, parties, and lots of other entertainment. It was quite an event! Fun as well as inspirational.</p>

<p>So what does all this have to do with you? Your child, too, can make a difference! The majority of the children who participated in the Millennium Dreamers event were between the ages of 8- 12. These kids each had one thing in common. They have a dream. Everyone has dreams. It’s just a matter of whether or not they’re ever acted upon. Most children have big dreams there’s no way they could materialize on their own. This is where you come in. And I don’t mean step in and try to fulfill their dreams for them. That would take up every minute of every day! Just be there for your kids and listen to their dreams. Encourage them to reach out to those around them and make a difference in the world. The younger children learn this the better…selfless children turn into selfless teenagers and then empowered adults. Involving your children in the community keeps them out of trouble and teaches them life-long skills in responsibility and how to work with others. Children do not learn these skills on their own. When your child asks you to donate food and toys to a local food drive or charity, give willingly and help them spend some of their own money or give away some of their own toys to help out. Most children love being able to give what little they have to others.</p>

<p>One Millennium Dreamer was too young to ride in the local bike-a-thon to raise money for charity, so he organized his own neighborhood bike-a-thon for kids and has raised more than $4,000 to help fight cancer. One girl was saddened to see foster kids moving from house to house with their belongings in garbage bags. She started going to yard sales to find duffel bags for them to carry their belongings in and now adds a stuffed animal and personal note from her in each. A large corporation heard about what she is doing and now donates all the duffel bags she can give away. Another boy was sad to see kids who couldn’t afford school supplies and started going around to office supply stores asking for donations. Office Depot soon became his corporate sponsor and now donates all the office supplies he needs.</p>

<p>Opportunities are out there wherever you look. See if your community has an office that organizes volunteer efforts in your area. The next time your child comes up with a great idea to make a contribution to your community, give it a chance and help them out. You’ll be amazed at the gradual changes in your child as you continually encourage these ideas. Our children are tomorrow’s future. Help them help us make this world a better place to live!</p>

  </header>

    <p>Millions of people spend billions of dollars, hoping to achieve the same thing, effective weight management. For years, many people have struggled to maintain a healthy weight and body. With a majority of Americans being overweight or even obese, the problem has grown into a crisis. Nearly 300,000 people die each year from weight-related disease.</p>

<p>Every week seems to bring out the next fad diet designed to help you “shed the pounds.” The problem is that most of these programs are not effective. Some work for a few days, but the weight comes back. Others are downright unhealthy. From products to exercise equipment, people are looking for the answer to their weight-management problem.</p>

<p>We believe the key to effective weight-management is a lifestyle of health. The pH Factor Weight-Management System combines a sensible eating plan, exercise, water consumption, and superior nutrition to help you create a lifestyle of health.</p>

<p>We feel the missing key to this challenge for many is the pH factor. Since blood pH is so critical to life, the body protects the blood at all costs. The typical diet consists of foods that when digested create acid that is put into the blood. The body has to neutralize this acid or risk major problems. Fat is one of the primary buffers used by the body to help deal with acid. When the body cannot neutralize acid, it stores it in fat cells.</p>

<p>When attempting to lose fat, we typically cut calories. But, if our system remains acidic, then instead of burning fat, which would release more acid into the system, the body burns muscle instead. The pH Factor Weight-Management System helps you to identify those foods that are creating excess acid in the system and also provides products that are alkaline. This combination can help you to raise your body pH, thereby creating an environment for health.</p>

<p>Tired of fighting to lose weight only to gain it back, again and again. It is a horrible cycle. Not only is it depressing, it is unhealthy. ForMor has discovered what we feel to be the missing key to long-term weight management. It is the pH Factor.</p>

<p>Welcome to the pH Factor Rapid Weight-Loss System. Success with this system requires strict adherence to the system. Failure to follow the system reduces the effectiveness of the system and lessens your chances of accomplishing the desired result.</p>

<p>A lifestyle of health is paramount to weight-management and health. This includes: sensible eating, moderate and consistent exercise, sufficient water consumption, and a good nutritional program. The pH Factor Rapid Weight-Loss System combines these into a simple plan. For the next 14 days, we are going to transform your body into a more effective, fat-burning machine.

<p>“pH” or “potential for hydrogen” is the measure used to determine whether something is an acid or alkaline. It is measured on a scale from 0 – 14, with 6.8 – 7.0 being considered neutral. Anything below 6.8 is considered acid, and anything above 7.4 is considered alkaline. The pH of the blood is just over 7.3. If blood pH is altered, major problems, including death, are imminent. Therefore, the body has multiple buffers in place to make sure the blood pH remains constant.</p>

<p>The primary buffers the body uses are: sodium, calcium, and body fat. When acid is present in the blood, the body looks to neutralize it with an alkaline substance. The primary neutralizing agent is sodium, then calcium. The body actually takes calcium from the bones in order to neutralize blood acid. If it cannot be easily neutralized, then the body stores the acid in the fat cells. That creates a major weight-management problem.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how this all works. Like any machine, our body needs fuel in order operate. Unfortunately, the fuel or food that most people use is not what the body needs or desires. In order to operate at peak efficiency, the body needs the proper food. The typical diet is high in food with little to no food value.</p>

<p>The problem goes much deeper than just lower efficiency. Like any machine, the fuel that we burn creates exhaust or by-products, sometimes called ash. In the body, our food is burned as fuel on the cellular level. The blood is the vehicle used to carry the food to the cell, and is also used to carry the waste or exhaust away from the cell to be eliminated.</p>

<p>When raw fruits and vegetables are consumed, the body breaks it down and sends it to the cells for fuel. The cell burns the fuel and the exhaust is an alkaline ash. When food from the typical diet is burned as fuel, the exhaust created is an acid ash. That acid is then carried in the blood.</p>

<p>Since blood pH is so critical to life, the body protects the blood at all costs. The body has to neutralize this acid or risk major problems.</p>

<p>Our goal then is to reduce the amount of food that creates an acidic ash and increase the foods that create an alkaline ash.</p>

<p>Effects of Acid</p>

<p>Acid in the body acts very much like acid outside the body. It creates waste. It ages the skin, degenerates tissues, and causes major problems. Additionally, most health concerns are created by an over abundance of acid in the system. Reducing acid in the system is critical to long-term health.</p>

<p>Many people love to drink a can of soda. If you look on the label, you will discover that a can of soda primarily contains acid. The pH of a soda is around 2.3. That is highly toxic. The body has to scramble to neutralize that acid in the system. It uses sodium, calcium from the bones or teeth, or anything else it has to in order to neutralize the acid.</p>

<p>Part of this system includes a slight change in some of the foods that we normally would eat. We understand that most people will not eliminate all the bad food from their diet, so instead of eliminating it, we are going to suggest a strategy of reduction.</p>

<p>Water</p>

<p>Most people are dehydrated. Drinking sufficient amounts of good water is critical to your success. In order to determine your water needs, convert your body weight to ounces and divide it by two (2), and that is how many ounces of water you should consume each day. Pure water is the only thing that counts toward your daily intake. Even water mixed with Pro Factor Shakes does not count toward your daily needs. For best results, you should drink only distilled water charged with the Crystal Catalyst Concentrate. Mix one-half (½) ounce of Crystal Catalyst Concentrate to one (1) gallon of distilled water.</p>

<p>Exercise</p>

<p>Building lean muscle, burning additional calories, and improving overall health are just some of the benefits of consistent exercise. For the next 14 days, commit to doing some sort of physical activity for at least 20 minutes a day for ten (10) of the 14 days of this program. That may include: walking, jogging, riding a bike, playing with your kids or grandkids, or other activities like, chasing your spouse around the house, that will raise your heart rate. Make it something you enjoy. Just commit to it for the next two weeks.</p>

<p>Extremes</p>

<p>In life, balance is to be desired. When anything is done to excess, we are in danger of getting out of balance. Usually it is not one piece of cake, or one soda that does us in. It is when sodas, cakes, and other acid-producing foods are consumed in excess that we create problems. You can even get out of balance on the other side. The life span of most professional athletes and vegetarians, is actually less than some couch potatoes. But, we need to identify the things we are doing in excess in our food consumption, and make some extreme choices on how to bring those into balance.</p>

<p>For instance, one customer was drinking 6-8 diet sodas per day. For him, it was an extreme choice to eliminate diet sodas from his daily life, but that was one of the extreme choices he has made. For others it may be 6-8 cups of coffee, or two desserts per day, or the mid-afternoon candy bars. We do not suggest that you necessarily quit these types of things cold turkey. Rather, start to exercise some discipline and control over yourself in these things. Instead of eight sodas a day, drink only two. Instead of four cups of coffee, drink only one or two. Instead of four packs of sugar in your tea, maybe only one or two. Instead of a late night snack, drink two glasses of water charged with the Crystal Catalyst Concentrate. Instead of always taking the elevator, take the stairs once a day. Maybe reduce your portion sizes when you eat. When you go to a buffet, maybe just go through once. Remove from your thinking the idea that when you go to a buffet, “you have to get your money’s worth,” by eating as much as you can. The purpose of eating is to give you enough fuel to get to the next meal and nothing more. For best results, we strongly suggest that you make some extreme choices.</p>

    <p>If we could choose right now, this moment, how we would live,</p>

<p>And,</p>

<p>Knowing, that the only way we could live the way we choose, is to be who we truly are…</p>

<p>Would we?</p>

<p>Your true self – do you know your true self?</p>

<p>Here’s a secret: who you truly are is a wonderful, warm, remarkable person, caring, kindhearted, unselfish and giving. Say hello, then become best friends with yourself. See only that which is good and you’ll like yourself and never mind being alone.</p>

<p>You’ll never be lonely if you’re true to yourself.</p>

<p>Knowing this – realizing the wonder and potential of YOU…</p>

<p>Would you commit yourself to a goal? Would you consciously feel each step you take, and honestly enjoy every footprint you make along the way?</p>

<p>Never mind the rainbow at the end of the pot of gold, or is it the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow? Never mind it. Enjoy the moments as they arrive, the colors of that rainbow, the green grass under your feet on the road of your journey, how you’ll cherish the feel of that gold (or goal).</p>

<p>If you think hard enough about it, isn’t the journey itself the true adventure? More so than the arrival at your destination. And, if so, then why not just enjoy the anticipation of the present moment as it melds into the next moment, and the next, and on into infinity. Isn’t this the way we can connect to all of life?</p>

<p>Now, if you would truly enjoy the journey, And, yes, take each moment as it comes, then you would be choosing how to live, each moment would be your choice.</p>

<p>Isn’t that what Life is all about? We don’t have yesterday. It’s gone forever. We can’t change the past. We have no control over it</p>

<p>Tomorrow is not in our power to perceive or conceive. We can think about it, plan for it, but why do we? We do not know how we will act tomorrow, until it becomes today.</p>

<p>We do not need to worry about any emergencies or situations that might come up tomorrow. We can only deal with what we are given today.</p>

<p>The only way you can make today reach into tomorrow is to make this day a success, by doing all that you can, all things great or small, important or trivial, in the best way you can.</p>

<p>Today is the day.</p>

<p>This is the moment.</p>

<p>Live it</p>

<p>with no ifs, ands or buts</p>
