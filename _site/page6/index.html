    <p>You’ve heard people say that affirmations don’t really work and that when you say them you are basically lying to yourself. After all, how can you state, “I am prosperous and living a life of leisure and joy,” when you are actually in debt and working two jobs?</p>

<p>In order to understand how effective affirmations are, you need to realize that when you say something that doesn’t already exist, you are setting the stage for change. You become a work in progress, transforming yourself into a position of creating what you want. It’s almost as if you are projecting yourself into the future, seeing and actually feeling what it would be like to manifest the statement.</p>

<p>Therefore, you want to affirm only what you want, by staying positive and clear. The more you feel what you are saying, the greater the likelihood that it becomes possible. What you are doing is creating a scene so real that the body becomes convinced it’s already happening. By doing this, the body responds by experiencing changes in the nervous system, its muscle groups and even cell structure, which ultimately causes behavioral changes. The thought is internalized, perceived as real and the behavior moves to meet the challenge.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of affirmations is to set your mind to act and think in ways that become natural and are in line with your new reality. In this way you create an inner momentum of possibility that you may never have had before.</p>

<p>The following are examples of affirmations you can use daily:</p>

<p>” I believe in myself and my true potential.</p>

<p>” I totally and completely accept health, wealth, and happiness into my life.</p>

<p>” Happiness comes to me easily and effortlessly.</p>

<p>” I am open to receiving great joy.</p>

<p>” I surround myself with positive, loving people who support, nurture and respect me.</p>

<p>” I give myself permission to be happy and joyful.</p>

<p>” My life is filled with limitless wealth and abundance.</p>

<p>These affirmations can jump-start your journey to enhanced self-awareness and enable you to reach your full potential. It is an effective tool to keep you motivated, inspired and emotionally healthy</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2014/05/03/exercising-with-kids/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Exercising With Kids</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Making exercise a priority is a challenge for everyone. And for parents it can be especially difficult to find time to workout because of the full plates that they often juggle. When summer arrives the juggling act becomes even more tricky with kids home from school and involved in extracurricular activities.</p>

<p>But, finding time for regular physical activity is so important that it should be a priority placed on your calendar, just like your kids, softball game. A parent needs to exercise not only for themselves, but also for their kids benefit. It’s important to set a good example. If your children never see you engage in fitness or if they hear you complain about working out, then they are going to have a negative image of exercise. Let them know that you workout to stay healthy, to be strong and to have more energy and stamina (so you can keep up with them)!</p>

<p>The big question is how to make it a priority that fits in your schedule. Well, it’s actually easier than you may think. With a little planning you can find ways to incorporate workouts into the time you spend with your children. Regardless of what age your children are, there’s a way to find time to workout (often even with your kids)! Here are some tips based on the age of your children.</p>

<p>Age: Infant through pre-school</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fit in exercise time while they are napping. Try a home exercise video, walking or jogging (if you have a treadmill), jumping rope.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Occupy them for even 15 minutes with a video or toy while you do some toning exercises like squats and triceps dips.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>* Grab your stroller and go for a brisk walk*. Or, buy a jogging stroller for more flexibility. With a jogging stroller you can walk faster, jog or even run at a fast pace. And, for veteran Roller-bladers, you can even use the stroller for some skating time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For younger children, you can use a back carrier to transport them while walking. This can burn even more calories as the extra weight makes it more challenging.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn on some music and dance together. Toddlers love dancing, especially when their parents joins in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Push your kid on a swing. And, after every push complete one squat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use an infant carrier or bike trailer to enjoy a bike ride together.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Age: Grade School</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Try rollerblading or skating together.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spend an afternoon at a park with a playground, but don’t spend the whole time relaxing on the sidelines, join in on the fun. Spend some time swinging to help workout your legs. Try making it across the monkey bars, even just once (it’s a great upper body workout and you’ll be amazed that your kid does it with such little ease). Try some pull-ups using a bar on the play-set. Do some triceps dips on a nearby park bench.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Play catch with a ball or get a small group together for a kickball or softball game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make Saturdays family bike outing day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Involve your kids while you strength train. Let them count your reps out loud for you and/or clock your rest time in-between sets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For pool outings, don’t just spend time soaking up the sun. Walk back and forth in shallow water while your kids have fun splashing about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On rainy days that force you inside, walk or run up and down the stairs. You might even make it a contest to see who can finish 5 complete rounds first.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Age: Teenagers</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Register for a fun run (or walk) event and spend time together training for the event.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Purchase a family gym membership and workout together weekly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Play tennis or basketball together.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider joining a community volleyball or softball team that includes enthusiasts of all ages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t just sit and cheer your kids at their sporting events. Every few minutes do some walking or jumping jacks or squats.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Implement a daily family walk each day before or after dinner.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Work together in the yard raking leaves, planting flowers, trimming trees.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, with all the above recommendations, you no longer have the I’m a parent, I don’t have time to workout.,excuse. If you implement these activities for just 30 minutes three times per week, you can easily burn an extra 450 calories or more! Plus, working out sets a great example for your children that will teach them at an early age how important (and easy) it is to make physical fitness a part of daily life. Exercising with your kids also provides the extra bonus of spending quality time together.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Where is Yesterday? Really where did it go? I mean………….. How can 24hrs just disappear?</p>

<p>Awareness, Education and Responsibility.</p>

<p>One of the best ways that i have found to build a healthy personality involves understanding yourself and your feelings. This can be achieved through this simple exercise i like to call “Awareness, Education and Responsibility” or “Intentional Seeing”</p>

<p>Awareness</p>

<p>You have to accept yourself for the person you are with good points and bad points with strengths and weaknesses……</p>

<p>….when you learn to develop the ability to stand back and look at yourself “honestly” and to candidly admit to others that you may not be perfect, but you’re all you got.</p>

<p>Maybe then, You will start to enjoy the heightened sense of “Intentional Seeing”</p>

<p>Your Future is in your eyes to see.</p>

<p>Education</p>

<p>Think about this, In order for you to become a Medical Doctor you have to go through some serious “education” likewise in order for you to become a Nurse also requires some “education”.</p>

<p>A Lawyer, A carpenter, A Teacher, A Fireman, A policeman, A Millionaire , An Architect, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Fill in the Blank</p>

<p>You have to think about your future possibilities and the “fact” that your potential is virtually unlimited. You can be the person you want to be. You can set large and small goals and make plans (education) and move step by step progressively toward their realization.</p>

<p>There are no Obstacles to what you can accomplish, Except the ones you created.</p>

<p>And last but not least…..</p>

<p>……Responsibility</p>

<p>You have to develop a perspective of what is causing you Unhappiness, then stand back from the situation and imagine the same thing happening to someone you love.</p>

<p>What advice will you give that person?</p>

<p>You know what ?</p>

<p>“If the mind can conceive it then you can achieve it”</p>

<p>I hope you are Responsible!</p>

<p>Be good.</p>

  </header>

    <p>If you are prepared, when the opportunity presents itself, you get lucky. Consider this…</p>

<p>Oprah Winfrey was making The Color Purple and she was sitting at lunch with Steven Spielberg, arguably the world’s greatest director. He was writing in his journal the goals he was going to accomplish: He wanted to start a new company with two partners, and he was going to make a billion dollars a year.</p>

<p>Oprah asked him, “Can I see your journal?” He handed it to her. After reading his goals, she inquired, “Do you mind if I copy that in mine?” Spielberg took her name, Oprah, turned it backwards, and she wrote, “I need certain people as my partners, and I’ll make a billion a year!” The rest is history. She became the first female billionaire.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Luck favors the prepared. Part of your preparation is writing down your goals.</p>

<p>Oprah had prepared herself by writing in a journal. She saw her future. She saw a man who was doing the future. She modeled him. She said, “I am going to be a person of action.”</p>

<p>Writing down goals and ideas is spiritual law.</p>

<p>Ancient wisdom says, “Write a thing; make it clear; it shall be established unto you.” Some of you need to write down your goals.</p>

<p>I teach it this way: “Write 101 goals.” That is your preparation. Keep adding to it. Do not cross them out like items on a grocery list. Write down “Victory!” when you achieve them.</p>

<p>Oprah became the first female self-made billionaire in history. Many people would say that was luck.</p>

<p>It was preparation before it was luck!</p>

<p>She wanted to be in The Color Purple; she read the book 20 times, and she met Quincy Jones. Quincy Jones told Steven Spielberg, “You’ve got to have this woman in your picture!”</p>

<p>The rest is history.</p>

<p>So many people talk about wanting to be lucky. If you don’t feel as though you are lucky right now, then you need to focus on your preparation.</p>

  </header>

    <p>We are all involved in this game called life and we will have our challenges and successes. One thing that will have great bearing on our attitude and lives is how we treat those challenges and successes.</p>

<p>Have you ever had one of those days where nothing seems to go right? What was your reaction? Some of us shrug off the petty things and some react violently. But do those things really matter?</p>

<p>There is a way of looking at those things that greatly smooths the bumps of life you encounter. When something frustrating, aggravating, challenging, infuriating and (you can add to this list) happens, use the following thought to control it:</p>

<p>“A few minutes, an hour, a day, a month, a few months or years from now, will this have really mattered?”</p>

<p>Looking at things from this perspective you will often find that it really wouldn’t matter, so why be upset about it right now?</p>

<p>In other words, if it would not make a difference at a later time or date, it probably doesn’t make any difference at this particular moment in time. Realizing this, you can go on to have a truly wonderful day and life.</p>

<p>By giving this some serious thought, you can see that the majority of things that bother us are truly petty in nature. They only become major when we react wrongly to them.</p>

<p>The next time you encounter one of these bumps in the road of life, pause and think to yourself, “Does this really matter?”. You will be pleasantly surprised at the betterment of your life.</p>

  </header>

    <p>In life, there tend to be ups and downs. When you are down, you have to keep yourself motivated and bring yourself up again. Negative thoughts, if excessive may sometimes affect a person’s self esteem. For example, you feel that you are not being acknowledged in the office and you get bored of working. This happens to almost anyone. Discouragement and lack of motivation will hinder you from focusing on your objective. Here are some methods I personally use to keep myself motivated, which I use over and over again.</p>

<p>Try having visual goals, something solid, and something material. Big dreams like owning a bigger house, a better car or a holiday of your dreams. Better still if you stick the picture of the house or car or holiday destination in your work station or cubicle. It keeps you sane under that tremendous work stress. When you have something to look forward to, the willpower will come naturally.</p>

<p>Do a to-do-list. It can be single item or many items, with or without expiry date. Researchers say that when tasks are easier accomplished when written down. It’s like a contract with yourself and contracts are meant to be honored. Having a to-do-list posted on the fridge is so much more effective than just remembering it mentally. Start a list today.</p>

<p>Small rewards can make real big difference too. Tell your friends and family you have achieved some of your plans. I am sure they are more than willing to give you small praises and keep you motivated. You can also reward yourself when partially achieve one major task. For example, if you plan to lose 10kg, buy yourself a new dress when you lost 5kg. By doing so, you will look forward to losing the remaining 5kg.</p>

<p>The last method I would like to share is reading motivational books. Walk into a book store or search for an e-book online. Motivational books need not to be in the form of lectures or pure methodology. There are some in the form of real life examples. I find the latter more inspiring and encouraging. Reading about others’ successes make me realized it sometimes achieving success is easier than you thought.</p>

  </header>

    <p>There are several pros and cons between artificial flowers and fresh flowers. The first thing is with artificial flowers there is very little to clean, no liquids to get split, no dirt to prune, just rest it down and go about your business. Another good feature about artificial flowers is once you have it, there is no reason to spend another dollar buying the same thing, and it will remain for a very long time. They may require a little dusting now and then, but this can easily be accomplished by wiping them with a slightly wet water cloth, or giving them a quick rinse with some soapy liquid. Note not all types artificial flowers can be washed with water. They will never get too big for their vases or pots as the case may be, and will clearly not need any nurturing.</p>

<p>Artificial Flowers are a great gift for a special someone, because they will have them for a very long time after the occasion, unlike real fresh flowers that will most certainly wither and die.They might be a bit expensive but are worth every cent in the long run, because it is like a medium to long term investment where you can see and feel your moneys worth for a long time to come. Another good point to note is they are available everywhere, you do not need to go to the Florist to get a an arrangement, there are many shops which stock these and they can be found in several patterns to suit all occasion, whether it is a Birthday, or Christmas or a wedding anniversary, there are many to choose from.</p>

<p>Fresh flowers on the other hand need special daily care, but they smell so sweet and look so gorgeous that a lot of people would rather use their money on these than on artificial flowers. Even though they know it will only last a week or two. A beautiful arrangement of say fresh carnations given to someone on a special occasion would probably be more loved than an artificial arrangement, because for some reason it feels more loving than an arrangement of artificial flowers.</p>

<p>In the professional world, artificial flowers in the office definitely appears to outnumber the desire for fresh flowers. It is more wise to buy artificial flowers particularly big artificial trees, fern and palm are a good example, to beautify the working environment, without the worry of having to care for them on a daily basis and it also removes the problem of arriving in the office on a Monday morning only to find that the plants are practically dead because they did not receive enough water over the weekend, not to mention the problem of dead leaves and petals all over the floor</p>
