  </header>

    <p>Making exercise a priority is a challenge for everyone. And for parents it can be especially difficult to find time to workout because of the full plates that they often juggle. When summer arrives the juggling act becomes even more tricky with kids home from school and involved in extracurricular activities.</p>

<p>But, finding time for regular physical activity is so important that it should be a priority placed on your calendar, just like your kids’ softball game. A parent needs to exercise not only for themselves, but also for their kids benefit. It’s important to set a good example. If your children never see you engage in fitness or if they hear you complain about working out, then they are going to have a negative image of exercise. Let them know that you workout to stay healthy, to be strong and to have more energy and stamina (so you can keep up with them)!</p>

<p>The big question is how to make it a priority that fits in your schedule. Well, it’s actually easier than you may think. With a little planning you can find ways to incorporate workouts into the time you spend with your children. Regardless of what age your children are, there’s a way to find time to workout (often even with your kids)! Here are some tips based on the age of your children.</p>

<p>Age: Infant through pre-school</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fit in exercise time while they are napping. Try a home exercise video, walking or jogging (if you have a treadmill), jumping rope.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Occupy them for even 15 minutes with a video or toy while you do some toning exercises like squats and dips.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>* Grab your stroller and go for a brisk walk*. Or, buy a jogging stroller for more flexibility. With a jogging stroller you can walk faster, jog or even run at a fast pace. And, for veteran roller-bladers, you can even use the stroller for some skating time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For younger children, you can use a back carrier to transport them while walking. This can burn even more calories as the extra weight makes it more challenging.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn on some music and dance together. Toddlers love dancing, especially when their parents joins in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Push your kid on a swing. And, after every push complete one squat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use an infant carrier or bike trailer to enjoy a bike ride together.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Age: Grade School</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Try rollerblading or skating together.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spend an afternoon at a park with a playground, but don’t spend the whole time relaxing on the sidelines join in on the fun. Spend some time swinging to help workout your legs. Try making it across the monkey bars even just once (it’s a great upper body workout and you’ll be amazed that your kid does it with such little ease). Try some pull-ups using a bar on the play-set. Do some dips on a nearby park bench.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Play catch with a ball or get a small group together for a kickball or softball game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make Saturdays family bike outing day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Involve your kids while you strength train. Let them count your reps out loud for you and/or clock your rest time in-between sets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For pool outings, don’t just spend time soaking up the sun. Walk back and forth in shallow water while your kids have fun splashing about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On rainy days that force you inside, walk or run up and down the stairs. You might even make it a contest to see who can finish 5 complete rounds first.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Age: Teenagers</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Register for a fun run (or walk) event and spend time together training for the event.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Purchase a family gym membership and workout together weekly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Play tennis or basketball together.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider joining a community volleyball or softball team that includes enthusiasts of all ages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t just sit and cheer your kids at their sporting events. Every few minutes do some walking or jumping jacks or squats.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Implement a daily family walk each day before or after dinner.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Work together in the yard raking leaves, planting flowers, trimming trees.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, with all the above recommendations, you no longer have the ‘I’m a parent ‘I don’t have time to workout’ excuse. If you implement these activities for just 30 minutes three times per week, you can easily burn an extra 450 calories or more! Plus, working out sets a great example for your children that will teach them at an early age how important (and easy) it is to make physical fitness a part of daily life. Exercising with your kids also provides the extra bonus of spending quality time together.</p>

    <p>Did You Know? Home Wind Power Kits Can Help You Save Money and Preserve Your Natural Environment</p>

<p>Defining wind power and wind power kits</p>

<p>How is wind, a variety of solar energy, generated? The answer may be attributed to several ecology-related reasons. Different parts of the earth have differences in air temperatures. This is because, the uneven nature of earth’s surface result in the sun heating up the earth by unequal amounts. This hot air, being lighter follows a convectional movement upwards. This creates a hollow in the lower parts of the atmosphere, which gets occupied by the cold air drifting in from nearby areas. Such movement of air is termed ‘wind’. These movements generate a type of motional, or kinetic, energy. Wind energy is obtained from this kinetic energy, which is converted by modern, sophisticated machines. The various equipments for tapping wind power and generating electricity are collectively termed -home wind power kits-.</p>

<p>What are the advantages of home wind power kits?</p>

<p>Concerns regarding the increasing rates of environmental pollution are being voiced all over the world. This pollution is often caused by the traditional fossil fuel energy sources. The prices of these sources are becoming too high as well. Hence, wind energy is gaining acceptance all over the world, and for different purposes as well. The existing modern, dynamic techniques are ideal for optimal harnessing of wind power, with help from the home wind power kits. The renewable nature of wind energy is a major benefit, as is the fact that no pollution is caused due to usage of wind energy. Regeneration of electricity systems is certainly possible by using these kits. Hence, the demand for the latter is on a high. People should, however, patiently learn and understand how these kits actually work. This, though, is a rather easy task.</p>

<p>Drastic reduction in electricity charges is one of the primary attractive features of wind power. While wind energy kits can bring down electric bills by around fifty per cent on average, such reduction in the bills can even go up to even ninety per cent, provided the home wind power kit performs really well. Surplus generation of electricity is also possible, in case a house is located in a suitable place. These un-utilized amounts can be sold to local owners of utility, in order to earn some cash. Convenience and ease of usage are common features of all wind turbines. All these turbines have two or three blades that are attached to a distinct rotor. The rotor then is connected to the principal shaft, which, in turn, helps to rotate the turbine. This entire process generates electricity. A height of around 100 feet (i.e., 30 meters) is generally recommended for setting up these wind turbines, since higher altitudes ensure continuous and unlimited wind flowing to the latter. Individuals can easily assemble the parts of a turbine on their own Alternatively they can take help from wind power workshops, books on this subject, and can also access online help.</p>

<p>Working advantages and downsides of home wind power kits:</p>

<p>All over the world, the prices of the traditional sources of power are escalating. In this scenario, wind energy offers a much more affordable source of energy. Hence, it is hardly surprising that people are using wind energy and home wind power kits, and that too for various purposes. The growing popularity of wind power kits can be attributed to their cost-effectiveness, power-saving characteristics, and their eco-friendly nature. These kits never produce any harmful greenhouse gases that might pollute the air and contribute to global pollution. Indeed, in the face of these substantial benefits, there are hardly any disadvantages of wind power systems.</p>

<p>A few thousand dollars is initially required, for installing the home wind power kits. This figure looks rather high at the first glance. However, compared with the manifold long run benefits of these kits, as well as the potential adverse effects of other alternative energy sources, this price is actually a rather reasonable one. All possible queries regarding installation can be solved by consulting the users’ manual that accompanies these wind power kits. Technical help is offered by many of the dealers; installation procedures are explained too in many such related websites. With its relative cheapness in use, as well as the large number of benefits wind power promises, demand for the latter is growing by the day.</p>

<p>Prior to setting up your home wind power kit, you should always refer to an instruction manual, so that you can know how to correctly set up the kit, and in which part of the house you should do so for the best results. You will also be able to know the source for free batteries and the ways to get the other components of the kit at reasonable prices. The way to wire the system as well as the necessary security precautions should is also included in the manual. After carefully going through all this in the manual, you can easily install your wind power kit and benefit from this.</p>

  </header>

    <p>The very first thing you need to do is decide what it is you’re really doing when you create your website or publish your ezine. Is it a hobby or is it a business? The difference, respectively, is the absence or presence of a profit motive. If it’s a hobby, fine. Don’t try and turn a profit, just enjoy yourself and make just enough to cover your expenses if you can. But if it’s a business, understand that making a profit is non-negotiable. It’s the reason for your business’s existence. You will no doubt have several purposes. But the profit motive is key.</p>

<p>Do whatever it takes to crystallize your purposes. For some people, just thinking about it and making a mental decision is sufficient. For others, crystallization requires seeing it in black and white. If that’s you, write down your purposes. Again, though, if you’re running a business rather than indulging in a hobby, turning a profit must be on your list of purposes (unless, I suppose, you’re running a non-profit business but we’ll leave that aside for present purposes). Recognize that purpose for what it is. Embrace it. PURSUE it with a vengeance. It’s nothing to be ashamed or coy about. So long as you intend to do so, and actually do so, by legitimate, honest and ethical means, give yourself permission to aggressively chase a dollar. Why crystallize your purposes in this way? Because they’ll keep you on track when you’re confronted by the naysayers who’ll inevitably pop up in your porridge.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Some potential sources of fraud – misrepresenting a business as that of someone else – are being slowly dealt with. Domain name registration has almost reached the point where there is some certainty. But it is still very far from being fully resolved. You can copy the real thing without too much difficulty, and with a bit of luck and some spelling mistakes a fraudster can still be in business.</p>

<p>But this type of fraud could be avoided by legislating to bring web site name registration into line with company registration rules, where similar names and ‘passing off’ are already dealt with. The methods for obtaining web site names that are primarily for ‘trade’ could also be addressed to ensure that they can only be obtained by registered businesses, and that the link between the domain name and the registered business is a matter of public record.</p>

<p>Some less obvious frauds</p>

<p>The Internet uses a technology called TCP/IP in order to send information between one point on the Internet and another. Unfortunately it was not designed to be secure, it was designed to be resilient. As a result it is possible to read information that travels around the Internet, and also to alter it. Therefore, it is possible both to read information that is not protected and copy information that has been protected using cryptography, (a technique that makes information unreadable to the unauthorized) and to change the unprotected information without being detected.</p>

<p>The effect of this is to create a situation where fraud can be carried out even when a genuine transaction is taking place. Fraud might include putting other recipient’s names on the distribution list to make you believe they are also involved or in agreement with what is going on. (This can happen in the physical world processing a credit card transaction multiple times on paper and forging the signature from the valid bill.)</p>

<p>The fraud is subtle because it is impossible for either party to detect. It is effective because the fraudster may have gathered information that allows them to completely impersonate both parties in the future.</p>

<p>Solutions for technical problems</p>

<p>These frauds require a manipulation of the Internet technologies, and so can be resisted by technology. However, the technology being marketed to solve this problem Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), in the way in which it is usually implemented, has fundamental weaknesses, and has been shown to be capable of being defrauded. Many other schemes, based upon codes of practice and logos shown on web sites, although worthy in themselves, are equally capable of being defrauded. It seems strange that some advertising appears to suggest encryption technology using a 40 bit algorithm is perfectly secure for commerce, whilst also saying that 128 bit algorithms are essential.</p>

<p>Alternative technologies are being delivered now that allow end users to gain immediate validation of web site content itself. They require software to be present in the machines of the end users to act on behalf of the user to carry out checks that the user can be prevented for doing themselves by competent fraudsters.</p>

<p>They also require competent registration procedures for Internet traders to make it more difficult for a fraudster to enter the system and pretend to be genuine. Such registration procedures are claimed to be in place..</p>

<p>One of the most important international developments for defining security behavior has been the adoption of the international standard ISO 17799 Code of Practice for Information Security Management. It is a comprehensive management standard for addressing the full range of issues for protecting information. Sensible adoption and application of the standard could provide significant benefits both to business and consumers. Self regulation schemes would do well to consider adopting it as a means of providing a common frame of reference for security and privacy claims.</p>

    <p>A certain educator was once asked at what point should a parent begin to prepare for child raising.</p>

<p>“How old are you?” the educator inquired.</p>

<p>“Twenty-three.”</p>

<p>“You should begin twenty-three years ago.”</p>

<p>What is the message? The single most important thing a parent can do to educate a child is to provide the child with a good role model. A parent has to work a whole lifetime becoming the type of person that he wants his child to become.</p>

<p>The most important people in the world in the child’s eyes are his parents. They are his first and most important teachers. The behavior of a child’s parents leaves a permanent impression in the child’s subconscious mind. Why is this so? The reason is that the most reliable source of priorities and values in a child’s eyes is his parents. Children have an innate trust in their parents. They feel that everything their parents say and do is the true and proper way to behave.</p>

<p>We all wish our children would do what we say and not what we do. However, this is not how the mind of a child works. The intellect of a child is undeveloped. As a result, children function an emotional level, absorbing more from what they see and hear around them than from what they are taught.</p>

<p>What is the take home message? The main thing for you to realize is that you have far more influence on your child than you probably realize. Your child is going to pattern himself after you. That is how nature set it up. Your job as a parent is to be the best role model that you can be. True, it is hard, but that is the way it is.</p>

<p>The following is a story I heard recently that brings out the extent to which your child learns from your actions.</p>

<p>A certain kindergarten teacher once warned a group of parents to be careful how they behave in front of their children.</p>

<p>“By the way your children play in school,” she said. “I know which of you treat each other respectfully. I know which of you use foul language at home. I know everything about how you behave in your home by the way your child plays, talks, and behaves.”</p>

<p>Remember, you might think that everything that goes on in your home behind closed doors is hidden from the world, but it is not. Your child sees everything. Your child is going to take your behavior and broadcast it to the world. Make sure that what he is transmitting is something that you want the world to see.</p>

    <p>Where is Yesterday? Really where did it go? I mean………….. How can 24hrs just disappear?</p>

<p>Awareness, Education and Responsibility.</p>

<p>One of the best ways that i have found to build a healthy personality involves understanding yourself and your feelings. This can be achieved through this simple exercise i like to call “Awareness, Education and Responsibility” or “Intentional Seeing”</p>

<p>Awareness</p>

<p>You have to accept yourself for the person you are with good points and bad points with strengths and weaknesses……</p>

<p>….when you learn to develop the ability to stand back and look at yourself “honestly” and to candidly admit to others that you may not be perfect, but you’re all you got.</p>

<p>Maybe then, You will start to enjoy the heightened sense of “Intentional Seeing”</p>

<p>Your Future is in your eyes to see.</p>

<p>Education</p>

<p>Think about this, In order for you to become a Medical Doctor you have to go through some serious “education” likewise in order for you to become a Nurse also requires some “education”.</p>

<p>A Lawyer, A carpenter, A Teacher, A Fireman, A policeman, A Millionaire , An Architect, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Fill in the Blank</p>

<p>You have to think about your future possibilities and the “fact” that your potential is virtually unlimited. You can be the person you want to be. You can set large and small goals and make plans (education) and move step by step progressively toward their realization.</p>

<p>There are no Obstacles to what you can accomplish, Except the ones you created.</p>

<p>And last but not least…..</p>

<p>……Responsibility</p>

<p>You have to develop a perspective of what is causing you Unhappiness, then stand back from the situation and imagine the same thing happening to someone you love.</p>

<p>What advice will you give that person?</p>

<p>You know what ?</p>

<p>“If the mind can conceive it then you can achieve it”</p>

<p>I hope you are Responsible!</p>

<p>Be good.</p>

    <p>When life gets unpredictable, there’s one thing Americans always want to hang onto: their money.</p>

<p>During times of national uncertainty, it’s only natural to want to hunker down and hang on to your cash — or at a minimum, squeeze as much as possible out of every paycheck (that is, if you’re still getting one).</p>

<p>Many Americans are feeling less secure about their lives than ever. In fact, 63 percent feel they will have to make changes in their day-to-day lifestyle, according to a survey by Wirthlin Worldwide, a McLean, Va.-based research firm. Fears of the unknown, job loss or having less income are also on people’s minds.</p>

<p>“If you hated financial planning to begin with, the thought of managing your money in trying times can be even more intimidating,” says Randy Schuldt, vice president, a Web site for the three out of four Americans who hate financial planning. “Although it may seem impossible to predict what the future will bring, there are some simple steps you can take to give you more control of your money in a changing world.”</p>

<p>To give you and your family something to hang onto during uncertain or changing times</p>

<p>Put it in perspective. If history is any indication, the economy may not suffer long-term ill effects from recent events. The Dow Jones industrial average — the oldest U.S. market benchmark — typically falls for a short time, but it has traditionally rebounded within six months. It happened after Pearl Harbor, the Gulf War, the World Trade Center bombing in 1993 and the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. Past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, but there’s a possibility that history may repeat itself. Fearful reactions will only make the short-term last longer.</p>

<p>Reduce your deficit. The nation’s economic outlook is nothing you can control, but you do have control over your own situation. If you’ve got credit card debt, take steps to pay it down. Start with the cards with the highest interest rate and pay more than the minimum on all your cards with balances. Instead of using a credit card for future purchases, get a debit card, which subtracts purchases directly from a bank account.</p>

<p>Protect future income. You owe it to yourself and family to protect your earning power with disability income insurance and/or life insurance. The lack of disability income insurance is the single biggest threat to the financial well-being of the American workforce, according to the Consumer Federation of America. It reports that 80 percent of U.S. workers either have no long-term disability income coverage or their coverage is inadequate.</p>

<p>Resist the urge to borrow from your 401(k). Many people are tempted to borrow from their 401(k) as a first resort, but it should be the last resort. Many people think because it’s ‘borrowing from themselves’ that no harm is done, but actually, they lose the chance to benefit from the tax deferral and compound interest on potential growth of their 401(k). That means your account will be much smaller when you retire. Also, if you quit your job or are fired, you may be required to pay back the entire loan immediately. If you are unable to do so, be prepared to pay income taxes and a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty on the loan.</p>

<p>Balance your budget. Now is a good time to get in the habit of budgeting your money. Track your expenses and spending for a month or so. It could reveal some money habits that need changing. And it can help you shape future habits, such as saving, charitable giving or just paying your bills on time.</p>

<p>Save for emergencies. Many people put off saving for a rainy day. It may not be raining on the economy yet, but the storms are brewing. A good rule of thumb is to have at least three months’ salary in the bank where you can access it for emergencies ranging from a leaky roof to layoffs at work.</p>

<p>Have a plan in case of layoff. During these tough times, more and more companies are cutting jobs, and yours could be next. If you haven’t done so already, update your resume. Be sure you understand what you’ll need to do to maintain health insurance coverage after a layoff. You might want to apply for a home equity line of credit. You don’t have to use it, but it’s hard to get approved after you’ve become unemployed.</p>

<p>Write a will. It was a good idea before the world changed, and it’s a good idea now. As long as you’re thinking about your family’s financial future, this is also a good time to formally declare your wishes about who gets what, and how much, after you’ve passed away. It’s also the only way you’ll be sure your wishes are carried out. You can modify your will as often as you like, for as long as you live. You may also need a durable power of attorney (POA), which formalizes who will make decisions on your behalf, if you are unable to do so.</p>

<p>Invest in the future. Resist the urge to put future plans on hold. If you want to buy a small business, adopt a child or retire early, put those goals on paper and follow through with a savings plan. It’s easier to stay on track if you have something to shoot for. Regardless of the condition of the world, keep improving the condition of your personal finances. An investment in your future is also an investment in future.</p>
