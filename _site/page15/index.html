  </header>

    <p>Garlic belongs to the Allium family of vegetables which also includes onions, chives, shallots and leeks. Current research has shown that a number of readily available foods such as garlic and onions that make up a healthy diet, actually have a major impact on cancer prevention. These cancer fighting foods seem to have the ability to interfere with the development of cancerous tumors. Cancer fighting foods all contain large amounts of certain phytochemicals. Phytochemicals were developed by nature to protect plants against damage caused by insects, disease and environmental stress. These phytochemical molecules are the ones that give fruits and vegetables their brilliant colors, provide the smell to garlic and the astringent taste to tea. It is very likely that these phytochemicals, not the vitamins and minerals, that are the source of the cancer prevention capabilities of these healthy foods.</p>

<p>Current research on the anti-cancer potential of the Allium family – particularly garlic – seems to show that these vegetables seem to reduce the incidence of cancers of the digestive system. Studies have also shown that garlic may also help prevent prostrate cancer. Garlic and onions contain allicin which is unstable and breaks down into a number of phytochemical compounds including diallyl sulfide and diallyl disulfide which appear to increase the ability of immune cells to fight cancer and also break down cancer causing toxic substances. These sulfur-based phytochemicals fight tumor development and are capable of neutralizing the effect of potential nitrite carcinogens which are used as preservatives in some foods. Studies have linked garlic, onions, leeks and chives to lower risk of cancers of the digestive system. The protective effect of garlic seems to be greater than that of onions, even though onion consumption has been shown to reduce the risk of stomach cancer. Most of the available research comes from epidemiological observational studies comparing populations who do or do not consume garlic and onions. Other studies are based on animal trials and cell culture studies. The October 2000 issue of the American Journal of Nutrition had a summary of a number epidemiological studies which showed that people who consumed cooked or raw garlic on a regular basis compared to those that ate little or none had about half the risk of stomach cancer and one-third less risk of colorectal cancer. These studies did not show that garlic supplements had the same benefits. It should be noted that these studies are not yet verified by clinical trials in human populations.</p>

<p>Our garlic consumption in North America is much less than many other areas of the world even though population areas where large quantities of garlic are consumed seem to have significantly fewer cancers of the digestive system. In the US, only 20% of the population eats more than 2 grams of garlic per week. Excessive garlic consumption can have adverse effects including bad breath, allergic reactions, stomach disorders and diarrhea. Freshly crushed garlic should be our choice as a source for the anti-cancer compounds we require.</p>

<p>Eating a healthy balanced diet can provide our bodies with many thousands of different phytochemicals. However not all fruits, vegetables and other plant products provide the best anti-cancer phytochemicals. They include: berries and citrus fruits, cruciferous vegetables, garlic and onions, green tea, omega-3 essential fatty acids, olive oil, tomatoes, soy products, red wine and dark chocolate.</p>

    <p>In the past it was not uncommon to find meat in every other dish prepared. But, things are changing now and health concerns being one major reason for such change. Animals are chemically injected to beef up and such chemicals are affecting their health and in turn ours. Also, the studies and researches showing negative health results for people consuming meat is an eye opener. Awareness regarding cruelty in animal killing for meat production has been another reason for people turning vegetarians.</p>

<p>Though there are points raised in favors of meat such as the protein and the nutrition content. Such points are put to rest with the fact that many healthier options are still available in vegetarian mode. Tofu, Soya bean are some of the premium source of proteins and are great alternates to the meat foods. The meat food being high on calorie count is the major source of fat accumulation in the body and thus obesity, the most troubling problem for people around the globe. Vegetarian recipes are relatively low on calories and good for health.</p>

<p>Common perception says that vegetarian dishes being low on calorie count are tasteless and boring to eat. But, a change in the cooking method is all take to change the taste buds. Meat burgers are a favorite with everyone. Turning to vegetarian mode can be quite painful for some. A healthier option is to enjoy the burger but, replacing meat with the vegetable content. Vegetarian black bean burgers are a great alternate to the meat hamburgers. Tofu, of Chinese origin, is considered the best alternate to meat in our diets. Tofu scramble is a great source of protein similar to scrambled eggs. Both black bean burger and tofu scramble are easy recipes to prepare.</p>

<p>It is always advised to include nuts in our daily diets to keep nutrition on high levels. Cashews, raisins, apricot, almonds are some nuts that are used as toppings as well. They can be consumed raw or integrating them in the preparation of easy recipes is another option. Raw cashew cheese is one of the recipes using nuts in preparation. Soaking them overnight and then consuming is easy on the digestive process and thus preferred. Soaking nuts while preparing raw cashew cheese is recommended to make it easier for nuts to blend in the mixture prepared.</p>

<p>Not all people are comfortable with the idea of switching to vegetarian food after all these years of eating meat. And changes in the dietary habits can affect health also. It is so advised to consult a dietitian who will help out to list vegetarian recipes that are high on protein and low on calorie count.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Along with the wheel, electrical energy is probably one of the greatest discoveries made by man. You can produce electrical energy using fossil fuels, water, wind or nuclear fission. This article will give you an idea on how many ways can be used to create electricity. Electricity can be created by huge turbines. These turbines need to be moved in order to produce energy.</p>

<p>One way in which to move those turbines is to burn fossil fuels. When the turbine’s blades are moved, they will generate vapor. The vapor is generated by heating water using big furnaces. The water is heated burning the fossil fuels: petroleum, coal, natural gas. In this way the in the air there will be huge amounts of CO2 released, and this means pollution for the atmosphere. This is why it is highly important that the methods of producing electricity.</p>

<p>Using water: one can create dams in order to harness the electricity. One popular method to produce electricity is to create dams to restrict the water and use the water to move the turbines. This type of energy will allow us to regulate the air pollution. But the downfall is the changes in the ecosystem as many rivers are being damaged. Of all the renewable energies on the planet, water accounts for almost 90%.</p>

<p>Using wind: wind can be easily converted into energy using wind mills or some wind turbines. In the last few years people have started to work on portable phone chargers that use solar power.</p>

<p>Using nuclear fission: nuclear fission can be used to produce atomic bombs but also energy. The nuclear fission will produce some chain reactions using uranium. This uranium is bombarded by neutrons and this causes it to split and create heat. This heat is used to create vapor and to move the turbines that will ultimately produce energy.</p>

<p>Using bio-waste: the latest technological advancements allow us to produce energy. Bio-gas is mostly used in rural areas in countries like India. They also have the technology that allows them to even use human waste and vegetable waste to generate energy.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Why should an employer bother with the emotions of its employees? Who cares if an employee has a problem, feels sad or depressed, or is simply unhappy with their job? “They can go find a job they like if they aren’t happy here” is the least effective route for an employer who wants to have a productive and successful business because unhappy employees cost the company money. Disgruntled employees are unproductive, uncooperative, and untrustworthy.</p>

<p>But how can you tell if your employees are unhappy?</p>

<p>The first and most important thing a manager or boss can do is get to know his or her employees one on one. This may sound like an amazing feat for an employer of thousands, but there are ways and this is one of the least expensive and most cost effective practices available to ensure that conflicts remain small and few. Taking a moment in passing to say “hello” or even setting aside one day a week or month to “check in” with your people says “I care about you and want to hear what you have to say.”, and really, who wouldn’t feel valued under those circumstances.</p>

<p>Next, consider absenteeism. An unhappy employee is four times more likely to miss work than their satisfied counterparts. Not all absenteeism is an employee “playing hooky” either; sadness, depression, and dissatisfaction in the workplace can lead to lowered immune response, stress related injuries and diseases, and poor lifestyle choices such as alcohol and drug abuse. If you notice higher than usual absenteeism in a department, this is a distinct sign that something is wrong top down or that there is a mis-communication among coworkers.</p>

<p>Additionally, if productivity is low or the “energy” in a department or sector you can be sure there are one or more unhappy employees about. It is in a company’s best interest to get to the root of the problem sooner rather than later as these sorts of problems rarely “take care of themselves”</p>

<p>There are things to do if morale is low or you have a frustrated employee and many ways to increase the potential for workplace satisfaction. These are just a few of the easiest and most cost effective ways to facilitate satisfaction in your people; rewards for a job well done, recognition when someone has exceeded expectations, a varied employee benefits plan that offers more than the usual health benefits or retirement plan, and flexibility in scheduling.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Sleep is the most important aspect for maintaining both Health and Wealth in the life of the human beings. When does a man sleep? He sleeps only when his inner mind or his soul, his sensory organs like ears, eyes, mouth, etc., stop their daily functioning. Sound sleep is one which is had at the proper time. To have proper health, one should have sound sleep. Some people can sleep at any place. Say in the train, bus, in the office, on the floor, immediately after getting into the bed. Such people seem to be extremely lucky as they can enjoy sleep which helps them keep good health. But others who do not get to enjoy this kind of sleep can read some tips given below.</p>

<p>Avoid eating late at night After having dinner, walk for sometime. This allows the food to digest. Read good novels. Sleep 2 hours after having food.</p>

<p>When you come home from work, have bath. Apply powder all over your body. This soaks water from your body and keeps skin dry. Wear loose comfortable clothes.</p>

<p>Before going to bed apply oil to your head. Every alternate day put oil in your ears, then wait for some time and allow the excess oil to drip down. Massage oil to your feet also.</p>

<p>While in bed forget about your day’s incidences. Relax. If you are unable to relax and sleep, then just keep your eyes closed and think nothing. Sleep on your left side.</p>

<p>Sleep in the east west direction. Do not sleep with the feet in the south direction. Change your bed sheet daily.</p>

<p>To summaries, sleeping is important for a healthy living.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2012/10/15/specific-personality-attributes/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Specific Personality Attributes</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>We want to evaluate more carefully specific personality attributes that have been found to be powerful predictors of behavior in organizations. The first is related to where a person perceives the locus of control, Self-confidence, self monitoring, and propensity for risk taking.</p>

<p>Locus of control some people believe that they are masters of their own fate. Other people see themselves as pawns of fate, believing that what happens to them in their lives is due to luck and chance. the first type who believe that they control their destinies, have been labeled internals, whereas the later, who see their lives as being controlled by outside forces, have been called externals. A person’s perception of the source of his or her fate is turned locus of control.</p>

<p>a large amount of research comparing internals with externals has consistently shown that individuals who have high scores in externalize are less satisfied with their job, have higher absenteeism rates, are more alienated from the work setting, and are less involved on their jobs than are internals.</p>

<p>The overall evidence indicates that internals generally perform better on their jobs, but that conclusion should be moderated to reflect differences in jobs. Internals search more effectively for information before making decision, are more motivated to achieve, and make a greater attempt to control their environment. Externals, however, are more complaint and willing to follow directions.</p>

<p>Self-confidence people differ in the degree to which they like or dislike themselves. This trait is called self-confidence. This is directly related to expectation for success. High self-confidence believe that they possess the ability they need in order to succeed at work.</p>

<p>Individuals with high self-confidence will take more risks in job selection and are more likely to choose unconventional jobs than people with low self-confidence. The most generalizable finding on self-confidence is that low self-confidence are more susceptible to external influence than are high self-confidence. Low self-confidence depend on the receipt of positive evaluation from others. As a result, they are more likely to seek approval from others and more prone to conform to the beliefs and behavior of those they respect than are high self-confidence.</p>

<p>Self-monitoring it refers to an individual’s ability to adjust his or her behavior to external, situational factors.</p>

<p>Individuals with high in self-monitoring show considerable adaptability in adjusting their behavior to external situational factors. They are highly sensitive to external cues and can behave differently in different situations. High self-monitors are capable of presenting sticking contradictions between their public persona and their private self. Low self-monitors can’t disguise themselves in that way. They need to display their true dispositions and attitudes in every situation; hence, there is high behavioral consistency between who they are and what they do.</p>

<p>Risk taking people differ in their willingness to take chances. This propensity to assume or avoid risk has been shown to have an impact on how long it takes managers to make a decision and how much information they require before making their choice. High risk taking managers make more rapid decisions and use less information in making their choices than do low risk-taking managers.</p>

    <p>The polar ice caps are melting, species are facing extinction and our climate has become more erratic than ever before. It is impossible to deny the need for intense change in the face of today’s gathering ecological crises. Now that scientific facts support the theories behind global warming, why aren’t more people paying attention—and how do we stop the damage?</p>

<p>Jonathon Porritt, adviser to the UK Prime Minister and author of the new book, “Capitalism as if the World Matters,” says the first step towards implementing change is to alter the approach to conventional environmentalism. To win people over and get them on board, he suggests focusing on the positive. “Change will not come by threatening people with yet more ecological doom and gloom,” says Porritt. “The necessary changes have to be seen as good for people, their health and their quality of life – and not just good for future generations.”</p>

<p>As the book title suggests, the biggest players in the game- businesses and politicians- must undergo a paradigm shift. “Anything vaguely resembling ‘business-as-usual’ is no less than a death warrant for the highest ideals of contemporary civilization,” says Porritt. “And that means we have to dig a lot deeper than today’s superficial, febrile political debates seem inclined to do.”</p>

<p>While acknowledges the big picture can be very threatening, he believes positive and profound change is possible. Through his work with Forum for the Future, an organization that works with a very wide range of some of the world’s biggest international companies acts as an adviser to a number of chief executives. They says the message that capitalism can be a change-agent for our future is starting to resonate. “Like it or not (and the vast majority of people do), capitalism is now the only economic game in town,”. “And that, of course, means that the emerging solutions have to be fashioned with the embrace of capitalism.”</p>

<p>They suggests that today’s model of capitalism is more and more dependent upon liquidating our necessary natural resources. This in turn has a ripple effect of magnifying divides between the rich and the poor worldwide.</p>

<p>They suggests that there are three ways we can transform capitalism in order to stop this from getting worse:</p>

<p>•Pay real prices for the things that we take out of nature</p>

<p>•Get the balance right between the short and long term</p>

<p>•Promote responsible consumption (energy, food, travel, etc)</p>

<p>“This combination is the most likely to provide a serious political alternative to today’s economic and political beliefs,”. “Sustainable growth is understood as answering the inescapable challenge of living within our “natural limits,” providing unique opportunities for responsible and innovative capital creators, and offering people a more equitable and more rewarding way of life.”</p>

<p>“Capitalism as if the World Matters” offers real-world solutions to the ‘destruction of the world’ problems that our global society faces. It has put his experience to work, outlining frameworks for sustainable capitalism and pointing to the initiatives some governments and businesses are already beginning to follow. So adroitly points out, unless conventional environmentalism throws its weight behind this type of progressive political agenda, the planet will continue to face steep decline.</p>
