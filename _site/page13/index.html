  </header>

    <p>Have you considered that many people eat a fast food diet? They are seen in Subway, Burger King, Wendy’s, Dominoes and many other such like companies. Their diets consist solely of foods from these companies and then they wonder about different illnesses they have plus the fact they are obese. How good are all these fast foods? Once in awhile they are not a problem but when they become the sole source of food then problems hit. The same is true of any pre-prepared meals. Some are better than others but the amount in them is often very small leaving the person feeling hungry and because of that hunger they then have to snack and the snack often leads to binging.</p>

<p>How many times have you had fast food and then find yourself hungry in a short period of time? One of the main reasons is that it takes the brain 20 mins to know it has had food. But most people can eat their meal in less than this time so the brain is saying “feed me!”</p>

<p>Many people have lost the art of cooking. Now for some they have never learnt the art and they need someone to teach them. For others they have a busy lifestyle and feel they don’t have time to cook a meal. Many children are growing up never having tasted real food. They know what pizza or burgers are like but to have a roast dinner and real fresh vegetables they have no idea what they taste like and they won’t be able to cook a meal for themselves when they leave home.</p>

<p>Do we have less time to cook than our forefathers? The answer is no. We work long hours but so did they. But we have every convenience in our homes which they didn’t have. They worked long and hard and yet were still able to cook dinner each night. They had to because the fast food chains didn’t exist then. We can try and justify what we do but our bodies are telling a different story. Too many have heart problems, diabetics, obesity and many, many more. Many try to eat less but end up gaining weight. They wonder why, because the body needs a certain amount of fuel to keep it going, but if we try and run it on empty then it will have to find fuel from somewhere else. The result is the body thinks it is in starvation mode and will then turn what we eat into fat so it has fuel once again.</p>

<p>Try running a car on empty and you will see it won’t get very far. Also try running a large car on the same amount of fuel as a small car, and then see which car can go the furthest. The small car will go further because it takes less fuel to run. The same is true with our bodies, the heavier we are the more fuel we need to run it, as we lose weight so the fuel needed is decreased and we can cut down again on what we eat.</p>

<p>But have you thought about going onto a healthy fast food diet? What could that include? Think about it for a moment. What is fast food? What does it achieve?</p>

<p>Fast food gives you food rapidly, it achieve you not being hungry for the moment.</p>

<p>The best fast food around is anything that takes no time to prepare. That doesn’t mean going to the stores and buying the biggest cake around and seeing that as fast food, because a cake will take time to prepare even if you didn’t do the preparation.</p>

<p>Fresh fruit and vegetables are one of the best fast foods around. Take raw vegetables and munch on them during the day. Eat an apple or two. Try new exotic vegetables and fruit. Add more and more of them into your eating each day. Think before you eat, and see what is going to be healthy for you.</p>

<p>In China people eat fruits that are in season, and April is the start of the pineapple and melon season. You can see these fruits being sold on every street corner. Take a pineapple for example, you go to buy one and they will peel it and remove the eyes from it. Then they cut it in half down the core, the core being so tender you can eat it. They place it on a stick and you have a pineapple lollipop to eat minus anything added. It takes them a few seconds to do. The melon they cut into cubes and put into a sundae dish and give you a little fork to eat it with. Again seconds to do and yet so refreshing.</p>

<p>Start your education today and think differently about fast foods, make a list of your own fast foods that can help you in your goals for losing weight.</p>

<p>There are a variety of ways to promote your web site. Blogs, direct links, advertising and search engine submission. Blogs are great ways to provide viewers to come visit your site. Many people create blogs just to promote their web site. Blogs can also be pinged so that spiders will visit your site and hopefully rank your web pages in their search engine index.</p>

<p>Links are also a great way to promote your web site. You can swap links with other sites that viewers might find interesting. You can also create one way links on articles and submit these articles to be used on other web sites. These articles are great advertisements for people to see and check out your site.</p>

<p>Advertising is always a great way to promote your site. You can promote your keywords at Google Ad-words or on a site that already has good traffic. No matter what kind of budget you have, you can find advertising that can work for you. Lastly, you can submit your sites to the search engines. If the search engines rank your site high in their indexes, you are almost guaranteed daily visitors. So follow the above tips to promote your web site fast and inexpensively.</p>

  </header>

    <p>As your teens grow older and come closer to adulthood however, it just becomes important to teach them how to be responsible and independent. This is especially true during the teenage years because much of what they learn about the value of hard work, responsibility, and money during this time will shape their adult behaviors.</p>

<p>Teaching a child the value of money is not all that difficult and you can start rather early. Something as simple as having a “piggy bank” is great way to teach children how to save early on in life. It’s a first step towards them learning how to not squander money on small things but rather to save for something more important such as a car, their college education, a home, or for the “rainy days.”</p>

<p>It is pretty well known that something given to you rarely has as much value as when you’ve worked to get it. A sure way of not instilling these values in your children is to give them far more than what they need and without them lifting a finger for it. Buying them expensive clothes or the car they always wanted may make them happy and be important for their status, but you’ll likely end up teaching them how to be dependent rather than independent.</p>

<p>Even if you paid for your child’s first car in its entirety, having them continually work to make token payments on it or the insurance premium can instill the sense that they’ve worked for what they have.</p>

<p>As children get older, working odd or part time jobs can teach them a great deal about responsibility, the value of hard work, and how good it feels to earn what you have.</p>

<p>These times it’s extremely difficult for a child to buy their first car or to pay for college all by themselves. It’s hard for parents to do the same, especially if you have multiple children, and especially if you haven’t started saving early. Not preparing for these expenses could mean having to buy an inexpensive car with constant repair bills that eat up more money in the end.</p>

<p>When it comes to handling money, the example you give your children may be the most potent lesson of all.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2013/01/28/a-bright-smile/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">A Bright Smile</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Gorgeous celebrities have to be that way, because their jobs depend on it. It’s a fact that the movie-going, television-watching public would rather look at beautiful people than unattractive people. Yet, not all of them are everyone’s “type.” So what makes them universally good-looking? Typically, pore-less skin, toned bodies, and…impossibly white teeth. Of these three things, white teeth are probably the easiest, and most realistic, element to adopt for themselves — whether it’s one job to look good or not.</p>

<p>Super white teeth are more accessible than ever, with the myriad of bleaching products on the market. It’s not necessary to go to the dentist to achieve the kind of smile that stops traffic, although the dentist will get it done faster. If you have the cash and want to spend it on teeth whitening, it is more effective to have it done at the dentist’s. But for those of us who don’t have movie-star-sized wallets, the drugstore will do just fine!</p>

<p>Don’t limit yourself to the gazillion whitening toothpastes out there. They are only marginally effective, and are more for maintenance, not removing stains that have been building up for years. If you would like to add a whitening toothpaste to your killer smile arsenal, ask your dentist for a recommendation. You don’t want a paste that’s too abrasive or will harm your teeth. What good are pearly whites if you’re going to have to trade them in for dentures before your time, because of a lousy toothpaste? Be safe.</p>

<p>There are teeth whitening kits available almost everywhere. Some of these contain a mouthpiece and peroxide gel, and others have conveniently combined that step and produced whitening strips — disposable after each use, and the gel’s already on them! Deciding between those types is a personal choice. Some might prefer rinsing out a mouthpiece each time to reuse, others may prefer to start fresh each time with new strips. The active ingredient is the same either way: peroxide. If you have a sensitivity to peroxide, talk to your dentist about alternatives. Realize also, that use of these products can make your teeth more sensitive, temporarily.</p>

<p>This is however only the beginning. Understand that there’s more than kits, pastes, and strips on the path to a bright smile. Teeth whitening is one piece of the puzzle; another is behavior. Do you put off your twice-a-year dental deep cleanings? If so, get on the phone and make an appointment, because those cleanings help get rid of built-up stains that could be standing in the way of the bright white you’re looking for. If you’re behind on visits, it will make it that much harder to whiten up.</p>

<p>Also, look at your consumption habits. How often do you have coffee, tea, red wine, liquid vitamin B? Do you smoke? If so, whitening teeth is going to be an uphill battle. Staining agents will sabotage your efforts, and if you’ve seen how much whitening kits can cost, you don’t want to jeopardize your progress. They’ll only work if you give them a chance. Much like exercise won’t do as much for you if don’t also change your diet, teeth whitening alone won’t give you a white smile — not while you’re staring down the bottom of a coffee cup.</p>

<p>A white smile is a very desirable thing to have, and while bleach works, it’s only half the work. Considering what a difference it can make in appearance, isn’t it worth trading a cup of java for a glass of milk, once and for all?</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2013/01/21/regulation-of-trans-fats/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Regulation of Trans Fats</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Should we regulate the amount of trans fats contained in the food we eat? A Canadian government task force on trans fats is recommending that all vegetable oils and spreadable margarine have the trans fat content limited to 2% of the total fat content and all other foods be limited to a maximum of 5% of total fat content. These new regulations would decrease the average trans fat intake by at least 55%.</p>

<p>What are trans fats? Fatty acids in foods are made up of polyunsaturated (like safflower oil, sunflower oil and corn oil), monounsaturated (like olive oil, peanuts, and avocados), saturated (like coconut oil, palm oil, butter and cheese) and trans fats (like margarine and shortening). Saturated and trans fats are linked to coronary heart disease. The majority of trans fats are produced by the food industry when it uses a process called hydrogenation to turn liquid vegetable oils into semi-solid products. This process hardens and stabilizes the oils, enhances the flavor and extends the shelf life of food products. These trans fats also break down less easily which makes them more suitable for frying. The majority of trans fats are found in foods made with shortening, margarine or partially-hydrogenated oils and in baked goods like crackers, cookies and donuts and in fried foods like french fries and fried chicken. The trans fat content of some of these foods can be as high as 45% of the total fat in the food product. Trans fats also occur naturally at fairly low levels in ruminant-based foods like dairy products and beef and lamb.</p>

<p>Are trans fats worse than saturated fats? There is a lot of evidence linking both trans fats and saturated fats to coronary heart disease. Trans fats appear much more dangerous because metabolic studies have shown that they increase the blood levels of our bad cholesterol (LDL) and decrease the levels of our good cholesterol (HDL). Saturated fats appear less damaging because they elevate the total cholesterol levels – both bad (LDL) and good (HDL). The Harvard School of Public Health found that removing trans fats from the industrial food supply could prevent tens of thousands of heart attacks and cardiac deaths each year in the US. The findings are published in the April 13, 2006 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Government organizations around the world have started to act to resolve the problem. In 2002, the US National Academies of Science recommended that trans fat consumption be kept as low as possible. In 2003 the World Health Organization recommended that trans fat intake be limited to less than 1% of overall energy intake. Also in 2003, Denmark set an upper limit on industrially produced trans fats in foods, limiting them to just 2% of the total fats in foods. They excluded meat and dairy products. In 2005 Canada required mandatory labeling of trans fats in packaged foods. The US followed in 2006 with a mandatory labeling for any foods containing 0.5 grams or more of trans fats per serving.</p>

<p>Is mandatory labeling sufficient? Shouldn’t we let informed consumers self-regulate the amount of trans fats they consume? Once the consumer understands how harmful trans fats are and that as little as 5 grams per day can lead to heart disease, then mandatory labeling will force the food industry to reduce the amounts contained in food products much faster than a bunch of government regulations, However what about restaurants and the fast food industry? Here is where the Canadian government task force recommendations are probably a good thing. Consumers do not know how much trans fats there are in french fries, deep fried chicken and baked goods. Therefore we should adopt the recommendation from final report of the Trans Fat Task Force that states – “For all vegetable oils and soft, spreadable (tub-type) margarine sold to consumers or for use as an ingredient in the preparation of foods on site by retailers or food service establishments, the total trans fat content be limited by regulation to 2% of total fat content.” This will allow us to eat restaurant and fast food industry foods with the knowledge that the trans fat content is limited to 2% or less.</p>

  </header>

    <p>It swims, it walks, it crawls, if flies, it does all of the above.</p>

<p>It’s your protein source.</p>

<p>This is hardly a secret to bodybuilding fanatics. While most of what you eat is generally from sources of carbohydrates, approximately one-fourth of the calories in your daily intake should consist of protein.</p>

<p>Otherwise, your workout hour will consist of anything but power.</p>

<p>Too often, dieters indulge in low-fat diets that deprive their bodies of much-needed protein. Thus, the body begins to devour its muscle tissue like a hungry vulture.</p>

<p>In order to nourish your body with the proper amount of protein, it is first necessary to determine what your body fat percentage is and then weigh your lean body mass up against your level of physical activity.</p>

<p>For example, if you are somebody who exercises on the average of an hour per week, then you’ll need to nourish your system with .7 grams of protein for every pound of lean body mass. So, if you have 140 pounds of lean body mass, you’ll need to take in 98 grams of protein per day.</p>

<p>If you are a more hard-core trainer who works out on the average of five hours per week, you’ll need to upgrade your protein intake to .9 grams per pound of lean body mass, which for the same person, would equate to 126 grams of protein per day.</p>

<p>Even couch potatoes need their protein, at least .6 grams for every pound of lean mass. Otherwise, serious health problems could result.</p>

<p>To engineer you protein diet, here are a few sources to guide you.</p>

<p>CHICKEN BREAST: This doesn’t necessarily come before the egg, but chicken breasts are among the most common of protein sources. Low in fat, remember to tear the skin off first while avoiding any fattening seasonings. Honey mustard is usually a great way to add some taste. The average chicken breast consists of 35 grams of protein.</p>

<p>EGGS: For a hard-boiled body, egg whites are tremendous in delivering the proteins that you need. Be sure to remove the yoke first (it’s loaded with cholesterol) before letting ‘em down the hatch. There are approximately 4 grams of protein in each egg white so you can load up on them throughout the day. Also, egg whites are fat free!</p>

  </header>

    <p>Along one’s life journey, there will definitely be ups and downs. There will be storms and difficult times. Have you wondered why this is so?</p>

<p>Basically, there are 5 reasons, which are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>To develop your character. When you are facing the most challenging time in your life, it is usually the best time to see your character. Do you give up easily? Or do you continue to bite your teeth and fight on like a warrior?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To test your faith. Usually prior to your success, you will face a lot of setbacks, and will start to lose confidence and faith. During this difficult time, it is the best time to test your faith, whether you believe that your success will be a reality in the near future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To learn new things. Every setback results from a cause, and this is the best time to learn from your mistakes, correct them, and not to make the same mistakes again in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To strengthen yourself. There is a quote which says “Things that do not kill you will only make you stronger”. After every setback, bounce back and be stronger.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To get out of comfort zone. Sometimes, when you are too comfortable in your work or journey to success, you will not improve, and tend to become complacent. Setbacks will only wake you up, and urge you to become hungrier for success.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Just remember, success is usually 1 step away. Work hard towards your goal now.</p>
