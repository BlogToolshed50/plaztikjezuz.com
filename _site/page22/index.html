  </header>

    <p>The individual should not forget to have some fruits and vegetables as well since these are rich in sterols that are known to keep the cholesterol levels down. All of these products are affordable and can easily be purchased in the supermarket.</p>

<p>Aside from eating properly, the person must also take the necessary precautions when consuming liquids. This means drinking a glass of red wine moderately, reducing the consumption of beer, drinking fresh juices, non-fat milk and water.</p>

<p>Apple juice for example has been known to reduce cholesterol levels by up to 50% when taken regularly. Other fruits can also do the same so cutting this and putting it into a blender can do the trick or getting this in bottled form.</p>

<p>The next step to lowering the cholesterol levels naturally is through exercise. This can be achieved in many ways such as brisk walking, jogging or running around the neighborhood. Learning a new sport and doing it regularly is another option.</p>

<p>Those who want to be looked after by a personal trainer can check out the gym since there are professionals that can create a program to achieve the person’s desired results. This will be a combination of Cardio-vascular exercises as well as weight lifting to burn the calories and lower the cholesterol levels.</p>

<p>There is another way to reduce the cholesterol levels but is only used as a last resort if these two do not work. The individual will be required to use medicine to make it happen. There are a lot of products out there and studies have shown this can drop the cholesterol levels by as much as 15% to 30%.</p>

<p>The person should be aware though that these drugs have certain side effects so it is best to consult a doctor first to make sure it is safe to use.</p>

<p>Cholesterol is something that is produced in the body and is also taken when food is eaten. The only way to make sure the levels in the blood doesn’t exceed the limit is to have a checkup regularly and watch the food that is being cooked or served in the restaurant.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Progress is being made on the home-front for those caring for family members suffering from Alzheimer’s or dementia. Currently, about two-thirds of Americans with those conditions are cared for at home.</p>

<p>As the disease progresses it carries with it a tremendous burden, both physically and psychologically on the family members-usually the husband, wife or partner–who are doing the care-giving. That is why it is vital that the family access community support systems, such as local Alzheimer’s organizations, that can provide reassurance and support groups.</p>

<p>It is also important that family caregivers seek outside help if they feel they are becoming ill from the strain of care-giving as the disease progresses. The strain can easily become intolerable for spouses trying to cope all alone at home with an Alzheimer’s sufferer and they themselves can have a physical or mental breakdown.</p>

<p>There should be no shame or guilt in seeking respite care from a professional home care agency. People who are not trained professionals often find it a strain to be caregivers, and should not feel that this makes them a bad or unloving partner or child. By turning to outside resources, a family can delay having to place Alzheimer’s sufferers in a long-term-care facility and, instead, keep them in the comfort of their own home.</p>

<p>Interim Health-Care has formed a strategic partnership with the Alzheimer’s Foundation of America (AFA) to support AFA’s goals related to dementia care professionals, including:</p>

<p>Raise the level of professional care provided to individuals who are suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and dementia;</p>

<p>Support professionals as they support those in need by providing practical training;</p>

<p>Set standards of excellence through the AFA qualification program;</p>

<p>Offer networking and advocacy opportunities.</p>

<p>A leader in the home health-care industry, recognizes the special needs of Alzheimer’s and dementia patients and their families. Creating an Alzheimer’s- and dementia-friendly and safe environment is an important step in making it possible for people to remain at home much longer and further into the disease.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Why is it important to teach personal mastery to your children?</p>

<p>Our children nowadays are the next generation. They would be facing a future that could hold immense possibilities and opportunities. But even with this bright future waiting for them, there is also a sad future waiting, a future where uncertainties and materialism can be prevalent. How can we prepare our children to face this kind of future.</p>

<p>It is beneficial to teach children a new set of values and attitude that would be good for the family. Helping children develop personal mastery in early age will help them have a mindset and habits that could be an instrument for their success in the future.</p>

<p>The recently discovered personal mastery would help an individual to develop skills and behavior that would help them deal with difficult circumstances. Personal mastery enables an individual to understand the strengths and weaknesses of other people and deal with their emotions. Aside from this, personal mastery encourages thinking outside the box and ability to take responsibility for their life.</p>

<p>These attitudes would be very beneficial for our kids. Personal mastery can also help children develop confidence grounded on reality, different from arrogance, live life and inspire other people and the world.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2012/01/21/anti-recession-tips/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Anti-Recession Tips</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Recession, for the uninitiated, is the decline of the economy. It is a widespread decline in the Gross Domestic Product, employment, and trade, which lasts from 6 months to one year. One of its usual effects is running out of funds because of the high prices of commodity and the increase in unemployment rate. So, if you are running a household, how do you make sure the impact of recession will not be too much to bear for your family? Here are some anti-recession tips that you can find useful during these hard times:</p>

<p>Grow Your Own Fresh Produce.</p>

<p>If you have been relying on the supermarkets for your daily meals, it’s high time to consider growing your own food. What can be better than taking advantage of your green thumb to avoid having to buy fruits and vegetables? If you are renting, growing vegetables and herbs in pots, also known as container gardening, can be useful. Mint, sage, rosemary, basil and thyme are great herbs for container gardening. If you do not have enough time, opt for low maintenance vegetables. Examples of low maintenance vegetables include garlic, onions, turnips, cabbage, leeks and kale. Now if you have a bigger backyard, growing your own fruits can be fruitful (pun not intended). Although this might require longer time since fruit trees can take at least about two years to yield crops. You can also do better in keeping a wide variety of your fruits and vegetables through trading with your neighbor’s grown fruit trees, vegetables and herbs.</p>

<p>Cut back on non-essentials.</p>

<p>You like soda? You like steak? But do you like to survive the recession? Then, cut on soda, meat and other non-essentials. You do not have to stop drinking soda or eating meat. But if you will only compute how much you can save without consuming any of these as often as you used to, you will see that it’s enough to tide you over.</p>
