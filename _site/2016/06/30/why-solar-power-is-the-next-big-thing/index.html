    <p>There are several compelling reasons why solar power is going to be massive over the next few years. Enrolling on a solar training course and why getting into this industry could be the best thing you ever do.</p>

<p>11 Reasons Why You Should Do It</p>

<p># Solar power is better for the environment than fossil fuels and once it reaches cost parity it will explode.</p>

<p># Solar power is growing in popularity and can be used to heat swimming pools, power cars, mobile phones, ipods and other small appliances.</p>

<p># Solar power is a renewable resource that will never run out.</p>

<p># The earth receives more energy from the sun in just one hour than the whole world uses in an entire year.</p>

<p># Shell Oil predicts that by 2040, 50% of the world’s energy will come from renewable sources such as solar power. Many major companies like Shell run their own solar training courses.</p>

<p># Two billion people in the world don’t have access to electricity. Solar power can solve this.</p>

<p># If you produce even more energy than you use, your utility company will buy it back from you.</p>

<p># Solar power is not affected by the supply and demand of fuel and is therefore not subjected to the ever-increasing price hikes.</p>

<p># By not using any fuel, solar panels do not add to the cost and problems of storage of radioactive waste or pollute the environment with the transportation of fuel.</p>

<p># Once your solar panels are installed, there is no more outlay! Its just savings. They are immediate and will last a lifetime.</p>

<p>The facts about solar power can’t be ignored! If you would like to get into this industry but don’t know how, please visit my blog for more information on solar training courses.</p>
