    <p>Recently yoga has been considered effective against various and diseases. The word yoga means union which to me means to separate from every sense of attachment from this materialistic word. This is achieved through discipline and a series of exercise called Asanas. Though you have comes from primarily the Hindu religion, it speaks more about living a healthy life and not about the religion itself. You can find numerous websites online to talk about yoga and gain a deeper understanding of the art of living healthy. I have personally not practiced yoga, but I’ve seen many of my friends doing well by being disciplined and practicing the art of yoga. If you’re still confused, whether you should practice yoga I suggest you get knowledge from an authorized teacher. You must own this practice yoga from a knowledgeable teacher and not from websites as many of the yoga needs an expert to teach you.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Many successful people on earth vouched that the “Adaptation” to the changing situation has helped them be so. It is said that, nature is in constant flux. It is perpetually trying to evolve and rebuild itself to accommodate the myriad species which populate it canvass. If you look around you, you can observe millions of species, each festooned with a uniqueness often bemusing us. Every single one of them plays a significant role in maintaining the nature. How they do it?. How they were able to surpass the vagaries of the nature?. The answer is simple —it is by Adaptation. They all have adapted to the changing and ever dynamic environment and started to survive nicely.</p>

<p>It is nothing but a lesson to the human being to adapt themselves to the changing situations and the challenges in the life. In the modern world we often encounter various situations and we need to act differently. The obvious solution may not be the right one. Such circumstances may stretch and vitiate our infallibility. It may deride us of our confidence. There is a possibility of losing ourselves in the process. The only way out is by adapting to the situation and learning to survive in extremities. Hence, one should develop the ability to adapt to the changing situation and the challenges to emerge victorious.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Cereal is a worldwide trusted and traditional breakfast and is the safest bet for the busy lifestyle we lead. It is readily available, easy to fix, digest and is healthy as it is low in calories. Truth is that most of the “low fat “cereals” available will not make you lose weight. But they contain less fat than their counterparts with good amount of calories. It is better that we eat much them during the coffee break and even use them as snacks during evening hours while watching the TV. It is proven that twenty three of the top 27 break fast cereals that are marketed in us for the children are an essential form of energy providing the iron, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and much more to take care of the healthy life.</p>

<p>Even the commercial brands tempting you with healthy additions such as oats, honey, nuts, and vanilla are not necessarily healthy than their natural counterparts. You have to judge yourself by experimenting them, compared to the natural ones. If you have cereals once in a day, it can have a remarkable influence on your health. You should choose the right cereals to meet out your requirement. Always choose the whole grain that contains at least 3g fibre in the form of bran, oatmeal and oats. The fiber found in the whole cereals helps make you full and keeps the hunger at bay. The whole grains also lower the risk of heart diseases and diabetes and reduces the weight gain. In all it is better that bet on whole grain to thwart various health issues.</p>

    <p>Business continuity Management is assuming greater importance of late in view of the changing dynamics in the field of marketing and over all business aspects. As I read elsewhere, it is a whole of business approach that includes policies, standards and procedures for ensuring that the specified operations can be maintained or recovered in a timely fashion in case of any disruption. In fact, the business continuity plan also assumes significance to have a better business continuity management in any organization. It is a comprehensive written plan of action that lays down the procedures and systems that are necessary to have continuity in the business strategy.</p>

<p>The main and major ingredients of a sound and effective business continuity management are the Business impacts Analysis, Recovery Strategies and the Business continuity Plans. The Business impacts analysis helps identify and measure the loss of business process in the event of any disruption. The recovery Strategy sets out the Recovery Objectives and priorities basing on the business impact analysis and helps the business to recover on time in spite of the eventuality. Any business house should concentrate on these vital aspects to ensure the smooth running of the business and meet out any eventuality and challenge the ongoing and unexpected risks in the business.</p>

  </header>

    <p>When everyone needs to go in for the online transfer of money from their bank accounts, the needed care is to be taken to do it in a safer way. I read in a news item that it has become easier for the fraudsters to hack the internet banking password by capturing your keystrokes on your key board. This has been made possible through couple of programs called “spyware” and Trojan Programs. They are said to be made to capture the strokes of your key board. These software are often installed through the downloads to capture the confidential data without your knowledge. Experts say that these software are often created in the PC of the users whenever they download certain free downloads or MP3 or even movie downloads. These software can even disable the anti virus software in your system.</p>

<p>You can avoid such hacking if you use the virtual key board as suggested by those in these field. Virtual key board is an online application, which substitutes the actual keyboard with a mouse. When you click on the virtual keyboard at the time of online banking, the monitor will flash the key board for your use. The virtual key board is able top protect your account or card information and pass word from such fraudsters. Banks often give you the choice to use the virtual key board. In a scrambled key pad, the position of the keys on the virtual key board keep changing every time you sign in. This makes the camera to capture the exact letters for the password and the hackers cannot easily do the fraud. Changing the password often is yet another way of protecting from such fraudulent activities by others.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Prevention is better than cure is the dictum that everyone tries to adopt, but fail to succeed due to lethargic attitude. Boosting your immune system helps you overcome many contagious disease and health issues like cold, flu and cough. When the weather cools, it is the right time to kick start the health. Your immune system is the natural defense system. It is able to protect the body against infection from bacteria and viruses from all over the world. When you are ill the immunity helps you fight the infection easily. For most of us, giving our immune system a kick start usually begins and ends with popping the Vitamin C supplements. Vitamin C helps you to boost our immunity to bugs. Foods are better than dietary supplements for the prevention of cold and flu.</p>

<p>For example, eating an orange is better than taking a vitamin C pills or supplement. Orange offers a combination of nutrients like magnesium, potassium and fiber. Eating vegetables and fruits rich in vitamin C helps you develop the immune system. The citrus fruits in particular are the great source of antioxidants which helps to combat the toxins and boost the immune system. A healthy food rich in zinc, magnesium and vitamin B are very useful to ensure the best immune system against various infections and you can lead a happy life without any hassle. A simple attention towards developing your immune system will keep the doctor away.</p>

  </header>

    <p>World oil demand growth in 2010 remained unchanged at 1.0 million barrels per day. Global oil demand is projected to continue throughout 2011, perhaps at a slow pace. It is predicted that the recovery in oil demand will take place in all the quarters, though with more strength in the second half of the year. The expected growth in oil demand next year comes as a result of not only the increased economic activity, but also from the low base in oil demand in 2009 and 2010. The bulk of the oil demand growth will take place in the non-OECD, mainly China, India the Middle East and Latin America.</p>

<p>On the product side, the demand for the industrial fuel will be strong as a result of continuing economic recovery. In the OECD, US oil demand is expected to be more than current year’s demands as the country continues to recover from the worst financial crisis. The middle east is having the proved reserve to the extent of 56% amounting to 754 Trillion cubic meters followed by Europe and Eurasia with 136 Trillion cubic meters of oil reserve. With the acceleration in the economic growth and the competition among various nations to be I the forefront with GDP growth and providing social security to the population, the oil demands is bound to grow in the days to come. But it is high time that we focus on the alternative energy sources for sustained and environmental friendly growth.</p>

  </header>

    <p>In the days to come, it is a must that the world should think and practice the ecological agriculture to sustain the growth and ensure food security without spoiling the environment. If you look at the various methods like growing the insect trapping plants in country like Kenya and the extensive use of the ducks by the Bangladeshi farmers to eat the weeds in the rice field, the awareness is slowly creeping on to the minds of the people and scientists to go in for the Eco-friendly cultural practices to sustain the growth in a balanced way. To feed the expected seven billion mouths by this year and about nine billion by 2050 without affecting the environment and depletion of the natural wealth, it is imperative that we adopt such ecological agriculture to produce what we need without much environmental issues.</p>

<p>In fact, many experts have cautioned that we should avoid the oil dependent model of industrial farming leading to the environmental disintegration. The researchers and the agricultural scientists re affirmed the truth that “Agroecology” can help the farms to become more resilient to the possible climatic changes like flood, drought and various soil and water related issues. If only the farming in the future is done as a sound ecological farming, it can easily boost the production and contribute better than the conventional farming. It is a matter to be followed by farmers of other countries by seeing the rice growers in Indonesia, Vietnam and Bangladesh who use the local knowledge to reduce the use of the insecticides to an extent of 35 to 92 percent without affecting the yield. The ecological agriculture is certainly going to reduce the cost of agriculture and improve the food quality as well.</p>

    <p>Though we claim to have invented various medicines to fight against the deadly disease Tuberculosis, the dearth toll due to the attack is not brought to the desired level. This infectious disease affects one third of the world population. It attacks the lungs and lead to the weight loss, fever and ultimate death. A chronic coughs is the right symptom which indicates the presence of the infection in the body.</p>

<p>It is confirmed that TB becomes active one in 20 cases and leads to death if unattended on time. It is an astonishing and agonizing fact that one individual gets affected by TB per second in the world. As much as 13.70 million chronic active cases, 9.3 million new cases were found in 2007. In all 1.8 million people died due to TB in the year 2007.</p>

<p>Most of the affected people are found in developing countries and the middle east. People with HIV infection are easily prone to TB attack and die fast as revealed in various studies. Despite various steps and the technological improvement and medicines scientists are not confident to eradicate these diseases completely even by 2050. However, it is a solace to the human that the novel vaccines, improved drugs coupled with the excellent diagnostic facilities we can hope for the reduction in the incidence of the disease in the future.</p>
