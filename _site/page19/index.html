    <p>The Basics</p>

<p>Before starting on how to design a website effectively, how about clearing some basic web design concepts? Designing Effectively</p>

<p>Now that you know what web design and related terms mean, lets get down to the real thing: Designing Effectively How to balance artistic design with practicality and functionality.</p>

<p>Use of graphics and content</p>

<p>Unless your website is all about graphics, how to make them, edit them or just a bunch of links to graphics websites, I suggest you use graphics sparingly, especially the flashing, twirling kind. They not only detract readers from the content, but they also take ages to load. You do not want your readers to leave your website because your graphically attractive page does not seem to load fast enough. Then again, too much text is boring. So mix and match the graphics and text on your page, having enough white space so that the page is not plain annoying.</p>

<p>Layout and design</p>

<p>While designing, keep in mind that poor layout and design will make your pages unreadable and difficult to keep your visitors on your website for long. Some of the things that make a poor design and layout:</p>

<p>Text that is too small to read</p>

<p>Color combination of text and background that make the text hard to read</p>

<p>Large graphic files that take forever to load</p>

<p>Multiple things that blink</p>

<p>Unclear navigation; over complex navigation</p>

<p>Paragraphs of type in all caps, bold, and italic all at once</p>

<p>Graphics that don’t fit on the screen (assuming a screen of 640×460 pixels)</p>

<p>Animations that never stop</p>

<p>Complicated frames, too many frames, unnecessary scroll bars in frames</p>

<p>Cluttered, not enough alignment of elements</p>

<p>——————————————————————————–</p>

<p>Some of the things that make a web-page stand out from the crowd:</p>

<p>Stay away from bad design features listed above.</p>

<p>Background does not interrupt the text</p>

<p>Navigation buttons and bars are easy to understand and use</p>

<p>Good use of graphic elements (photos, subheads, pull quotes) to break up large areas of text</p>

<p>A large site has an index or site map</p>

<p>Link colors coordinate with page color</p>

<p>Every graphic link has a matching text link</p>

<p>Animated graphics turn off by themselves</p>

<p>Pages download quickly</p>

<p>All pages have the immediate visual impact within 640 x 460 pixels</p>

<p>Planning</p>

<p>Most of the time, all it takes to design your website effectively is a little planning. When designing a website, it needs to be clean, uncluttered, attractive and easy for users to read and find what they need. Begin with a web design plan:</p>

<p>what colors do you want to use?</p>

<p>Are these colors complimentary?</p>

<p>What items – text, images, data – do you want to put in your pages?</p>

<p>What layout do you want? Look at other websites and then decide.</p>

<p>Follow the above steps to get a website that speaks for itself and your business. You can always contact me for suggestions and web design projects.</p>

  </header>

    <p>With the advent of the technology and change in the time, there is a great uplift in the standards of the common man. Man has become the loyal associate of the technology. There is no work which has been left in which man is not taking the assistance of the technology. And the fuel to this technology is energy. Energy is the resource on which all the components of technology depend upon. That is the reason, every day millions of people read, see or listen about something or another related to technology.</p>

<p>As we all know that technology has become an important part of human existence. And we even know that to let this technology keep assisting us, we need fuel which is energy. So indirectly, it means that to let our life be easy and convenient – we need technology and with retrospect we need energy. Now, you would think what the source of energy is? The resources of energy have been divided into two parts – renewable and non-renewable resources. The renewable resources are those which can be used again and again. And these are generally natural resources like air, water, sunlight etc. On the other hand, non-renewable are those which can’t be used again and again, they get exhausted after the usage. Some examples are coal, petroleum etc.</p>

<p>The above passage shows the types and examples of the resources of energy. But due to the extensive usage of all the resources, the time is coming when all these sources get exhausted, especially non-renewable. Their over usage has arise this situation. This has become the question of worry among the scientist of the world. That is the reason that the government of all the different countries have started different types of programs for the conservation of energy. And even, UN has given great emphasis to the convention of energy. There are many programs which are initiated by the different countries. Even every year, the head of countries meet in the summits and discuss about the various components of conservation of energy. In all these meetings, they always try to find out the solution to the problem coming in conversion of energy. Even scientists are trying to find other alternative to the resources of energy which are available to us.</p>

<p>The world is doing all type of efforts for conservation of energy because of one and utmost reason and that is – energy is the fuel or source on which all the technologies are based on. For instance, we need electricity to work on computers and computers are the pivotal part of any kind of official as well as private work. And this energy is generated by the help of water but due to global warming and water pollution, we all know what is happening to this natural resource. This is the just the smallest instance which I have kept in front to of you. But here are many to be counted and explained. So, conservation of energy is important to live life.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2012/05/30/steps-to-overcome-the-fear-of-change/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Steps to Overcome the Fear of Change</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Step One: Envision what you want</p>

<p>Making change especially when it comes to your work the fear of change tends to stop us in our tracks. We worry what will happen if we make a mistake or do the wrong thing. It can be the result of not having a clear vision of the desired state. Be clear about what you want (this is true in most aspects of life) and then you’ll be able to see how this change will get you closer to your goals.</p>

<p>Step Two: Take a field trip</p>

<p>Do you remember how exciting it was as a child to take a field trip somewhere during school time? You took your lunch, maybe rode a bus and actually got to leave the school during the day to go somewhere new? Prior to making a big change in your life, take a field trip. That is, take a day off and visit the place you may be going to live or work and spend some time imagining your new life. This field trip will get you excited about positive change in your life.</p>

<p>Step Three: Talk to others who care</p>

<p>Start talking to others who care about you and would be interested in this change. Don’t talk to people who don’t care and would not be interested in this change for you. The more you talk to others in your support network, the more committed you will become towards your plans.</p>

<p>Step Four: Build new networks</p>

<p>Build new networks to support this change. If you are moving to a new line of work or perhaps a new area to live, start to build new connections. This will give you a foundation, structure and sense of place in your new home.</p>

<p>Step Five: Move towards pleasure in your life</p>

<p>Much of the fear of change comes from living a secure life of avoidance. That is a life of staying clear of risks and essentially hiding under the rock most of your life. With a strategy moving towards pleasure, you start to take more calculated risks. Be more proactive and you will start to move towards what you want vs. avoiding what you do not want in your life.</p>

<p>Step Six: Look at your life as a series of steps</p>

<p>Rarely does major change occur as a result of one big change. To move towards more of what you want in your life, it takes small steps. Whether you are seeking a new relationship, a new line of work or a new area to live, make small steps first.</p>

<p>Step Seven: Make many small changes with the big change</p>

<p>Changing relationships? Buy some new clothes! Changing work? Get a new desk or planner! Changing where you live? Start grocery shopping at a new store. Small changes help to lay a foundation for bigger changes.</p>

<p>Step Eight: Change, especially after 40. It is time!</p>

<p>Change can start to break old patterns of living and thinking. As a result, new opportunities emerge for growth and happiness. Change after 40 can be challenging. Think about change in mid-life as mandatory for good health.</p>

<p>Step Nine: Look back and forward</p>

<p>Think back to when you made major changes in your life. You will discover in most cases they all lead to positive outcomes. Trust your intuition. Look forward to the result of new changes. Imagine all the new possibilities!</p>

<p>Step Ten: Celebrate</p>

<p>No one is going to throw a party for you after you make a major change in your life. In fact you may even lose a few friends who don’t agree with your change. The best way to reinforce every small change in your life is to celebrate yourself! Plan in advance a trip or small party right after the change. This will serve as an anchor for the future that you can overcome the fear of change.</p>

<p>No reason to FEAR</p>

<p>There is no reason to ANY longer be afraid of change after 40. It is healthy, necessary and MANDATORY for recreating a second half of life which WORKS better for you!</p>

  </header>

    <p>Despite being triggered by external factors, stress in actuality is produced by your own mind. It is a result of your desire to achieve something or comply with a specific standard or requirement. And because we can never expect to thrive without abiding by one set of standards or another, it is typical that your day to day activities would make up your daily dose of stress.</p>

<p>But the kind of stress that compels you to achieve or perform accordingly are expected and necessitated. On its own, it is enough to use up your energy reserves. It is the unwanted and useless stress you unconsciously encumber yourself with that you must learn to handle and do away with.</p>

<p>The Importance of Being and Staying Rational</p>

<p>What sets man apart from beasts is his rationality. However, despite the privilege to exercise his reasoning to handle his affairs effectively, too often a time, he burdens himself with irrational thoughts. All of which adds up to unwarranted stress. And as he fusses about the minutest and least insignificant of details, he blames anything and everything for his stressful woes. Everything except himself that is.</p>

<p>It is the unwanted irrational thoughts that you often obsess about that unnecessarily add to your mental burden. And it goes without mentioning, that you should learn to distinguish and discard them on the spot. Common examples of these are the following: being overly finical with your appearance, obsessing about the tiniest insignificant detail that is really unimportant to begin with, sacrificing too much just so that you can please everybody literally, and corrupting your mind with too many “what ifs” or “what could best”.</p>

<p>Uncluttered your mind by ridding yourself of these kinds of irrational thoughts that do not hold water. When you find yourself under attack by them; stop them right then and there, breathe in, and focus on being still until such time that all those voices in your head are silenced. Only when your mind is still should you give yourself the chance to sift through each one, so as to segregate the important ones from those that aren’t.</p>
