    <p>Burn fat while you sleep! Eat whatever you want and still lose weight! Don’t suffer through hours of grueling exercise to burn fat!</p>

<p>You’ve probably heard all these phrases before but are the fat burners containing that these claims are attached to really that effective and are they safe?</p>

<p>The primary ingredient in fat burners is the herb ephedra, also known as ma huang, or it’s manufactured version ephedrine. It has been used in Chinese herbal medicine quite safely and effectively for thousands of years. It is often combined with synthetic or herbal versions of caffeine (e.g. guarana, yerba mate or kola nut) and aspirin (e.g. white willow bark).</p>

<p>But does it burn fat?</p>

<p>The answer to that question is yes. It does effectively help the body to preferentially burn fat for energy. But, according to medical studies, there can be side effects, some of which are quite serious.</p>

<p>to burn fat through several means.</p>

<p>-Its chemical makeup increases the breakdown of fatty tissue for fuel. -Its stimulatory properties help to increase resting metabolism. This process is known as thermo-genesis, which is essentially excess heat production. You body burns more calories simply by producing more body heat. -When herb ephedra is combined with caffeine and aspirin, it may have appetite suppressant effects. -The nervous system stimulation you get can help you maintain your energy levels, which can aid you in your exercise program.</p>

<p>When used according to instructions and in moderate doses, studies suggest that fat-burning formulas containing herbal, caffeine and aspirin can be safely and effectively used to SUPPLEMENT a good fat-burning program.</p>

<p>Fat burners should never be used as the sole means to achieve fat loss. A good fat loss program must also address diet and exercise, contrary to the hype you see on television and in print. Anyone who relies solely on pills to lose fat is usually doomed to regain the lost weight and potentially quite rapidly after they stop taking the pills.</p>

<p>There is a reason for this weight gain. These pills are effective, therefore the person does not necessarily have to change the habits that made them overweight in the first place. When a person discontinues use without changing those habits, almost inevitably the weight will come back.</p>

<p>The fat-burning effects do not come without a price, however. It has a number of side effects and should not be taken by people with certain conditions.</p>

<p>Some of these side effects may include: sleeplessness, increased heart rate and blood pressure, anxiety, skin flushing or tingling and nausea.</p>

<p>People who should not take include those suffering from heart disease, anxiety attacks, high blood pressure, diabetes, adrenal disease, thyroid disease or prostate disorders. If you are taking medication for high blood pressure or are taking antidepressants or MAO inhibitors, you should stay away. Also, it is not recommended for pregnant women to use this herb.</p>

<p>Now that you know some of the pros and cons of taking supplements you, along with your doctor, can use this information to help decide whether or not ephedra is right for you.</p>

  </header>

    <p>We’ve all had the unfortunate experience of being convinced by a pushy salesperson to buy something we weren’t sure we wanted. You may have really wanted the product, but after being pushed into buying it, you don’t want it anymore. You either return it or you never patronize the store again.</p>

<p>Since you resent the experience, don’t recreate it for others when you are trying to sell. If you didn’t appreciate being pressured and disrespected, no one else will either. When trying to close a sale, you must always respect the opinions and thoughts of the buyer. If all you care about is your payoff, then you will drive customers away. They will be afraid to buy from you, thinking that you will always try and convince them to buy things they don’t want.</p>

<p>Here are some helpful tips to help you close a sale with class:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Be kind and considerate: Don’t try to fool the customer. You will get a lot further if you’re really trying to help them, instead of just helping yourself</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give them a direct request: You can let them know what you want them to do. Don’t be afraid to ask for the order or sale. The customer will know you are being honest if you tell them what you really want them to do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give them two choices: Explain that, on the one hand, if they buy the product, they will be receiving these benefits. Then explain that if they don’t buy, they will be losing out in certain ways. People like to have the pros and cons laid out for them. It helps them make a decision the smart way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give them plenty of room to think: Don’t pressure them. As I mentioned above, people resent purchases they were pressured into. Real persuasion doesn’t involve pushiness. The choice belongs to your customers, so let them make it.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We learn at a very early age how to persuade people to do what we want them to. Some of us learn it better than others, but EVERYONE can LEARN to use simple persuasion techniques to make their life better. Often, earning more, finding the perfect mate, being pushed around less, and being happier in life don’t have anything to do with you as a person. It has more to do with knowing a few simple rules of persuasion.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2015/11/02/the-happiness-of-others/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">The Happiness of Others</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Is there any necessary connection between our actions and the happiness of others? Disregarding for a moment the murkiness of the definitions of “actions” in philosophical literature – two types of answers were hitherto provided.</p>

<p>Sentient Beings (referred to, in this essay, as “Humans” or “persons”) seem either to limit each other – or to enhance each others actions. Mutual limitation is, for instance, evident in game theory. It deals with decision outcomes when all the rational “players” are fully aware of both the outcomes of their actions and of what they prefer these outcomes to be. They are also fully informed about the other players: they know that they are rational, too, for instance. This, of course, is a very far fetched idealization. A state of unbounded information is nowhere and never to be found. Still, in most cases, the players settle down to one of the Nash equilibrium solutions. Their actions are constrained by the existence of the others.</p>

<p>The “Hidden Hand” of Adam Smith (which, among other things, benignly and optimally regulates the market and the price mechanisms) – is also a “mutually limiting” model. Numerous single participants strive to maximize their (economic and financial) outcomes – and end up merely optimizing them. The reason lies in the existence of others within the “market”. Again, they are constrained by other people’s motivations, priorities ans, above all, actions.</p>

<p>All the consequential theories of ethics deal with mutual enhancement. This is especially true of the Utilitarian variety. Acts (whether judged individually or in conformity to a set of rules) are moral, if their outcome increases utility (also known as happiness or pleasure). They are morally obligatory if they maximize utility and no alternative course of action can do so. Other versions talk about an “increase” in utility rather than its maximization. Still, the principle is simple: for an act to be judged “moral, ethical, virtuous, or good” – it must influence others in a way which will “enhance” and increase their happiness.</p>

<p>The flaws in all the above answers are evident and have been explored at length in the literature. The assumptions are dubious (fully informed participants, rationality in decision making and in prioritizing the outcomes, etc.). All the answers are instrumental and quantitative: they strive to offer a moral measuring rod. An “increase” entails the measurement of two states: before and after the act. Moreover, it demands full knowledge of the world and a type of knowledge so intimate, so private – that it is not even sure that the players themselves have conscious access to it. Who goes around equipped with an exhaustive list of his priorities and another list of all the possible outcomes of all the acts that he may commit?</p>

<p>But there is another, basic flaw: these answers are descriptive, observational, phenomenological in the restrictive sense of these words. The motives, the drives, the urges, the whole psychological landscape behind the act are deemed irrelevant. The only thing relevant is the increase in utility/happiness. If the latter is achieved – the former might as well not have existed. A computer, which increases happiness is morally equivalent to a person who achieves a quantitatively similar effect. Even worse: two persons acting out of different motives (one malicious and one benevolent) will be judged to be morally equivalent if their acts were to increase happiness similarly.</p>

<p>But, in life, an increase in utility or happiness or pleasure is CONDITIONED upon, is the RESULT of the motives behind the acts that led to it. Put differently: the utility functions of two acts depend decisively on the motivation, drive, or urge behind them. The process, which leads to the act is an inseparable part of the act and of its outcomes, including the outcomes in terms of the subsequent increase in utility or happiness. We can safely distinguish the “utility contaminated” act from the “utility pure (or ideal)” act.</p>

<p>If a person does something which is supposed to increase the overall utility – but does so in order to increase his own utility more than the expected average utility increase – the resulting increase will be lower. The maximum utility increase is achieved overall when the actor forgoes all increase in his personal utility. It seems that there is a constant of utility increase and a conservation law pertaining to it. So that a disproportionate increase in one’s personal utility translates into a decrease in the overall average utility. It is not a zero sum game because of the in finiteness of the potential increase – but the rules of distribution of the utility added after the act, seem to dictate an averaging of the increase in order to maximize the result.</p>

<p>The same pitfalls await these observations as did the previous ones. The players must be in the possession of full information at least regarding the motivation of the other players. “Why is he doing this?” and “why did he do what he did?” are not questions confined to the criminal courts. We all want to understand the “why’s” of actions long before we engage in utilitarian calculations of increased utility. This also seems to be the source of many an emotional reaction concerning human actions. We are envious because we think that the utility increase was unevenly divided (when adjusted for efforts invested and for the prevailing cultural mores). We suspect outcomes that are “too good to be true”. Actually, this very sentence proves my point: that even if something produces an increase in overall happiness it will be considered morally dubious if the motivation behind it remains unclear or seems to be irrational or culturally deviant.</p>

<p>Two types of information are, therefore, always needed: one (discussed above) concerns the motives of the main protagonists, the act-ors. The second type relates to the world. Full knowledge about the world is also a necessity: the causal chains (actions lead to outcomes), what increases the overall utility or happiness and for whom, etc. To assume that all the participants in an interaction possess this tremendous amount of information is an idealization (used also in modern theories of economy), should be regarded as such and not be confused with reality in which people approximate, estimate, extrapolate and evaluate based on a much more limited knowledge.</p>

<p>Two examples come to mind:</p>

<p>Aristotle described the “Great Soul”. It is a virtuous agent (actor, player) that judges himself to be possessed of a great soul (in a self-referential evaluative disposition). He has the right measure of his worth and he courts the appreciation of his peers (but not of his inferiors) which he believes that he deserves by virtue of being virtuous. He has a dignity of demeanor, which is also very self-conscious. He is, in short, magnanimous (for instance, he forgives his enemies their offenses). He seems to be the classical case of a happiness-increasing agent – but he is not. And the reason that he fails in qualifying as such is that his motives are suspect. Does he refrain from assaulting his enemies because of charity and generosity of spirit – or because it is likely to dent his pomposity? It is sufficient that a POSSIBLE different motive exist – to ruin the utilitarian outcome.</p>

<p>Adam Smith, on the other hand, adopted the spectator theory of his teacher Francis Hutcheson. The morally good is a euphemism. It is really the name provided to the pleasure, which a spectator derives from seeing a virtue in action. Smith added that the reason for this emotion is the similarity between the virtue observed in the agent and the virtue possessed by the observer. It is of a moral nature because of the object involved: the agent tries to consciously conform to standards of behaviour which will not harm the innocent, while, simultaneously benefiting himself, his family and his friends. This, in turn, will benefit society as a whole. Such a person is likely to be grateful to his benefactors and sustain the chain of virtue by reciprocating. The chain of good will, thus, endlessly multiply.</p>

<p>Even here, we see that the question of motive and psychology is of utmost importance. WHY is the agent doing what he is doing? Does he really conform to society’s standards INTERNALLY? Is he GRATEFUL to his benefactors? Does he WISH to benefit his friends? These are all questions answerable only in the realm of the mind. Really, they are not answerable at all.</p>

    <p>Picture it your minivan is stopped at a rest area. Your partner sits at the wheel while you are buried under a mess of unfolded maps. You feel tense as you debate over directions while your jumpy kids in the back seat are spreading chocolate over each other. Aah, the joys of a family vacation.</p>

<p>Don’t despair, not every trip has to be like that. By making plans in advance, you can help ease tensions on the trip and turn it into a family adventure filled with wonderful memories for everyone. Before getting started, consider these quick travel tips.</p>

<p>Where are we?</p>

<p>Try to map out your trip in advance or at least be prepared with a road atlas in the car. Tt is easier navigating and folds over easily so it can be tucked away in the glove compartment. A great innovation is that maps are organized by geographic region, not by the alphabet, according to the way you actually drive.</p>

<p>Are we there yet?</p>

<p>Let your children also have their own map so they can follow along with you. Use a road atlas to teach your children how to use maps and help them learn to answer that gnawing question, “Are we there yet?” Make a game out of it and try to see who can calculate the distance the fastest.</p>

<p>I have to go!</p>

<p>Plan exciting pit stops along the way to give everyone a chance to stretch their legs and use a restroom. Choose interesting locations and tourist attractions such as the world’s largest coffee pot in Saskatchewan, magnetic hill in New Brunswick or a haunted lighthouse in Ontario. Make these stops part of the fond memories of your family trip.</p>

<p>I’m bored!</p>

<p>Entertaining car-based activities for the kids will help make the journey more pleasant for everyone. There are a variety of great board games available in compact sizes, which use magnets to ensure pieces stay on the board. Other options include reading out loud, singing or listening to audio books. Consider the classic games of “I Spy”, a scavenger hunt or even counting cows, horses and other unique items you identify.</p>

<p>I’m hungry!</p>

<p>To avoid grumbling stomachs keep some snacks handy such as fruit, granola bars or juice boxes to keep everyone satisfied while you search for the next rest stop.</p>

<p>Spending time together on a road trip is a great way to have quality time with your family. Don’t let it ruin your trip. Instead make it part of the adventure and the wonderful memories. Not only will some advance planning make your trip a lot more pleasant, it may keep everyone talking to one another!</p>

  </header>

    <p>To be a safe and predictable person for those around you at work and at home, it is essential that you are able to maintain your composure when you feel like your ‘buttons’ are being pushed. This strength will help you to achieve your goals in business as well as your goals for your personal relationships.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Share negative emotions only in person or on the phone. E-mails, answering machine messages, and notes are too impersonal for the delicate nature of negative words. What feels like a bomb on paper may feel like a feather when delivered in person.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pepper your responses with the phrase, “I understand”. This phrase will support your goals when the tension is high and you need to find common ground to form compromises or agreements with the other party.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take notice when you feel threatened by what someone is saying to you. Resist the temptation to defend yourself or to “shut down” the other person’s communication. It will take this kind of discipline to become an open, trusting communicator.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Practice making requests of others when you are angry. It is often much more useful to make a request than to share your anger. For example, if the babysitter is driving you crazy by leaving dirty dishes in the sink, it is better to make a request of them than to let your anger leak out in other ways such as by becoming more distant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Try repeating the exact words that someone is saying to you when they are in a lot of emotional pain or when you disagree with them completely. This mirroring technique can keep both the speaker and the listener ‘centered’ in a difficult conversation, especially when the attitude of the person doing the mirroring is to gain understanding of a different point of view.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take responsibility for your feelings to avoid blaming others. Notice when ‘blameshifting’ begins to leak into your speech. “I feel angry when you are twenty minutes late and you don’t call me” is much better than, “You make me so mad by being late.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn to listen to the two sides of the conflict that you are in as if you were the mediator or the counselor. If you can listen and respond in this way you will bring peace and solutions to the conflict more quickly. For example, in response to an employee’s raise request, you might say, “On the one hand I understand that you really need the raise, and on the other hand I represent the company, whose funds are very scarce at this time. Is there a way that I can work on your compensation package that does not involve cash?” Here, the mediator’s point of view can look for the creative compromise that takes into account the limits and the needs of both parties.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take a playful attitude towards developing the skill of emotional self-control in high conflict situations. You could view maintaining self-control in a tense, angry conversion as an athletic feat. You could also view developing this skill as similar to working out at the gym with weights – the more that you use your self-control muscle the bigger it will grow and the easier it will be to remain calm when tension is great.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wait a few days to cool down emotionally when a situation makes you feel wild with intense feelings, such as rage. As time passes, you will be able to be more objective about the issues and to sort out the truth about the situation more clearly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make a decision to speak with decorum whenever you are angry or frustrated. If you give yourself permission to blow up, people will not feel safe around you. They will feel that you are not predictable and will carry ‘shields’ when they are near you. The fear and walls of others will not support your goals for success in relationships or at work.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2015/07/23/the-fruits-of-summer/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">The Fruits Of Summer</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Peaches, plums and nectarines are a rite of summer – and a must for healthy summer skin</p>

<p>It’s a sure sign of summer: mounds of sweet, juicy peaches; plump, flavorful plums; and aromatic nectarines that seem to arrive with the warm days of late spring and leave with the first cool autumn breezes.</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s just a coincidence that these same peaches, plums and nectarines – long considered a delicious source of nutrition like most fruits and vegetables – are also important sources of antioxidants, essential for maintaining healthy skin. When the sun begins to shine, these fruits begin to work their magic.</p>

<p>A recent study conducted by the University of California – Davis found that these three summer stone fruits are rich in phenolic compounds which act as antioxidants, and include ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), carotenoids (orange or red colored substances found in many fruits) and pro vitamin A/beta-carotene.</p>

<p>Here’s how antioxidants work to protect the skin. Photo aging – skin changes resulting from exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays – happens where there is an imbalance of pro-oxidants (free radicals) and antioxidants in the skin’s cells. The sun’s UV rays can accelerate free radical production while at the same depleting antioxidants. Photo-aging usually manifests itself in rougher, drier, wrinkled and less elastic skin.</p>

<p>Antioxidants protect skin cells by counteracting free radical activity. In addition,</p>

<p>Vitamin C is critical for the formation of collagen in the skin, and beta-carotene (transformed in the body into vitamin A) is important for maintaining the growth and health of skin cells.</p>

<p>All are good reasons to stock up on tree fruits between now and September. The best reason is just to enjoy these juicy, flavorful fruits that seem to be bursting with sunshine – all the while combating the harmful effects of the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays.</p>

<p>A long legacy</p>

<p>According to The Peach Sampler, a cookbook compiled by Eliza Mears Horton, peaches originally came from China: the fruit is referred to in the writing of Confucius in the fifth century. Peaches then traveled, via caravan routes, to Persia, Greece and Rome. In the United States, peaches first appeared only years after the pilgrims landed in 1620.</p>

<p>Interestingly, peaches, plums and nectarines are members of the rose family. Nectarines, which many consider a form of the peach, is actually a very distinct fruit and likely predates the peach. Nectarines take their name from the drink of the Olympic gods: “nectar.”</p>

<p>Plums come in two types: Japanese and European. Japanese plums – tarter, juicier and larger than European plums – are the most abundantly produced varieties in the United States. They were first introduced to the United States in the late 1880s when legendary plant breeder Luther Burbank imported the parent stock from the Satsuma province of Japan. They come in a variety of colors – red, purple, black, green and yellow. European plums were introduced in the United States by the Pilgrims: they tend to blue or purple, more oval-shaped, smaller and sweeter than the Japanese varieties.</p>

<p>Today, there are more than 1.7 billion pounds of plums, peaches and nectarines packed each spring and summer in the United States, with more than 75 percent grown in California.</p>

<p>The state commercially produces more than 200 varieties of peaches, 200 varieties of plums and 175 varieties of nectarines. Most peach varieties are freestone, meaning the flesh of the fruit easily slips away from the pit. For nectarines, freestone varieties are generally available in June and July. All plum varieties are cling-stone.</p>

<p>Summer-white varieties of peaches and nectarines have a pale white skin with splashes of bright pink, while the flesh is light pink or white. Summerwhite varieties represent about 20 percent of the peaches and nectarines packed in California.</p>

<p>The basics: Selection, storage and handling</p>

<p>When stone fruits are purchased in the grocery store, they often feel hard to the touch and are not fully ripe. The best way to ripen stone fruit is to place it in a paper bag, fold the top of the bag over loosely, and place the bag on the counter for one to three days. Never store hard fruit in the refrigerator, in plastic bags, or in direct sunlight.</p>

<p>Check the fruit daily. When it’s ripe, it will be aromatic and will give slightly to gentle pressure. Once ripened, it can be stored in the refrigerator for about a week.</p>

<p>Peaches, plums and nectarines are easy to prepare: simply rinse under cool water and they’re ready to go. Unless a recipe calls for it, you never need to peel any of these fruits: in fact, many of the antioxidants found in stone fruits are contained in the peel, and it’s highly recommended that the peel be consumed along with the flesh.</p>
