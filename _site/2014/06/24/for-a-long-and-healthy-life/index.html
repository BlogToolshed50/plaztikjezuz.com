    <p>Everyone wants to live a long healthy life. The people that do usually have a list of common items that help them stay fit.</p>

<p>See Your Doctor: Anytime you want to change your life style and get fit you should start out with a visit to your doctor. You should ask your doctor for a complete physical. This should help find any problems keeping you from achieving your health goals.</p>

<p>Eat Right: Eating the right foods will work wonders for your health. Not only do you need to restrain your portions to a reasonable level you should also keep track of how much fat you are taking in each day.</p>

<p>A Balanced Diet: You should always try to eat a normal balanced diet. Do not go overboard with any of the fad diets. Common sense and watching your sugar intake should go a long way in keeping you healthy.</p>

<p>Overwork: Your job is an important part of your life. Without your place of employment you cannot enjoy a lot of the better things in life. Try to find a balance that will work for you without killing yourself. Working too much takes its toll on your body.</p>

<p>Exercise: Starting an exercise program will help your overall health greatly. Always see your doctor before starting any new fitness program. You should start out slowly with your new routine. Walking is a great way to ease into exercise. You should add more challenging things a little at a time.</p>

<p>Get Rid Of Stress: Stress gets you down before you know it. Try to get rid of anything in you life that is making you nervous or worried. The more peaceful you can make your life the better off you will be.</p>

<p>Your Mind: Keeping your mind active is an important key to good health. Your thoughts and dreams will take you beyond your years.</p>
