    <p>More than 200 known diseases are transmitted through food, and Health Canada estimates that every year approximately two million Canadians suffer from illness caused by food-borne bacteria. While the majority of these cases are mild, Health Canada reports that 2 to 3 percent of all cases will lead to chronic health problems and as many as 30 will die from complications due to food poisoning.</p>

<p>Susan Brunt, a Toronto based family physician and LYSOL spokesperson, reminds us that food safety starts in the home and offers helpful hints on how to keep your home healthy this summer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check expiration dates on all food</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bring food home from the supermarket promptly to refrigerate or freeze</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thaw frozen food in the refrigerator or microwave-not on the counter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use separate cutting boards for raw meats and vegetables to avoid cross-contamination-the accidental spread of germs from food to food or from surface to food</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Disinfect food preparation surfaces with Wipes. They offer a convenient way to prevent cross-contamination in your kitchen and around the grill area</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chill and refrigerate leftovers immediately and use within 2-3 days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Date leftovers to make sure you use them before they spoil</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Dr. Brunt also reminds us that the most severe cases of food poisoning tend to occur in the very old, the very young, and those with weak immune systems.</p>
