    <p>You’ve heard people say that affirmations don’t really work and that when you say them you are basically lying to yourself. After all, how can you state, “I am prosperous and living a life of leisure and joy,” when you are actually in debt and working two jobs?</p>

<p>In order to understand how effective affirmations are, you need to realize that when you say something that doesn’t already exist, you are setting the stage for change. You become a work in progress, transforming yourself into a position of creating what you want. It’s almost as if you are projecting yourself into the future, seeing and actually feeling what it would be like to manifest the statement.</p>

<p>Therefore, you want to affirm only what you want, by staying positive and clear. The more you feel what you are saying, the greater the likelihood that it becomes possible. What you are doing is creating a scene so real that the body becomes convinced it’s already happening. By doing this, the body responds by experiencing changes in the nervous system, its muscle groups and even cell structure, which ultimately causes behavioral changes. The thought is internalized, perceived as real and the behavior moves to meet the challenge.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of affirmations is to set your mind to act and think in ways that become natural and are in line with your new reality. In this way you create an inner momentum of possibility that you may never have had before.</p>

<p>The following are examples of affirmations you can use daily:</p>

<p>” I believe in myself and my true potential.</p>

<p>” I totally and completely accept health, wealth, and happiness into my life.</p>

<p>” Happiness comes to me easily and effortlessly.</p>

<p>” I am open to receiving great joy.</p>

<p>” I surround myself with positive, loving people who support, nurture and respect me.</p>

<p>” I give myself permission to be happy and joyful.</p>

<p>” My life is filled with limitless wealth and abundance.</p>

<p>These affirmations can jump-start your journey to enhanced self-awareness and enable you to reach your full potential. It is an effective tool to keep you motivated, inspired and emotionally healthy</p>
