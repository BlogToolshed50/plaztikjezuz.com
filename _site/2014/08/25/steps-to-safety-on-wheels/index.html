    <p>Are your kids safe when riding on wheels – bicycles, scooters, skateboards or in-line skates? Safe Kids Canada, a national child safety program, has launched the “Got Wheels – Get a Helmet!” campaign this spring. Safe Kids Canada urges Canadians to follow these three tips to keep their children safe:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure your child wears a helmet that fits correctly, as well as other protective gear.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Bike: bike helmet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scooter: a bike helmet, elbow pads and knee pads.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In-line skates: a bike helmet, wrist pads, elbow pads and knee pads.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Skateboard: a skateboard helmet, wrist pads, elbow pads and knee pads.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure your child rides or skates in a safe environment – away from cars and other vehicles.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Scooters, in-line skates, and skateboards do not belong on the road.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bicycles are classed as vehicles, but research shows that children under 10 should not ride their bicycles on the road. They do not have the physical skills or the judgment to stay safe in traffic. Children over 10 need good training and lots of practice before they can ride on the road. Kids need to practice these skills with adult supervision in safe places.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Supervise children until at least eight years of age. Know your child’s abilities.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Most injuries on wheels happen because children lose control and fall. Children need to practice controlling their equipment, and they need your guidance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your child needs to learn basic skills, such as controlling speed and turns, braking, balancing and avoiding obstacles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reinforce safety rules while you supervise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometime between the ages of 8 and 10, your child will develop the coordination and judgment required to ride or skate safely without your supervision – but not near traffic.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
