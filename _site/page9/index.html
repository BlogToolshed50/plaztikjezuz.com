  </header>

    <p>With all of the focus recently on ‘Going Green’ and Eco-Friendly products, the construction industry has stepped up and starting looking for Eco-Friendly products and energy saving techniques to help minimize the impact on the environment. While there are a wide range of products (too many to talk about in one article), I would like to focus on one specific category- kitchen and bathroom cabinets.</p>

<p>It is hard to imagine that something that is traditionally made completely from wood can be eco-friendly without sacrificing strength or durability, but there are several products that have become a more viable option in the past couple of years without sacrificing quality or looks. On the high end of the market, you have Bamboo cabinets. There are only a handful of manufacturers out there that make bamboo cabinets, but they are growing in popularity. Since bamboo is one of the fastest growing plants in the world and can be easily replenished (much faster than any other tree), manufacturers are starting to make use of this valuable resource. While the entire cabinet could not be made out of bamboo, they use thin layers of bamboo as a veneer for the cabinets. With solid plywood construction underneath, these cabinets offer durability, strength, and a unique look for your kitchen… however, you should expect to pay a higher price for them. Since all of the cabinets are made to order, lead times are going to longer and the total cost is going to be higher. But the added benefit of knowing you are doing your part to help the environment is well worth it.</p>

<p>While very few people realize it, RTA Cabinets or Ready-To-Assemble cabinets are fast becoming an eco-friendly product. While they are still made of the traditional hard woods, they have a very different approach to the manufacturing process. Unlike custom made cabinets that will only use select grades of wood and specific pieces of the tree, RTA Cabinets actually use 100% of the tree in their construction, reducing the number of trees needed for manufacturing and eliminating excess waste. Since the cabinet box is made of plywood, they are able to utilize the less desired parts of the tree and still create a sturdy cabinet box.</p>

<p>Another feature of Ready-To-Assemble cabinets that is seldom factored into the environmental impact of a product is the packing material used, fuel used and pollution created during shipping. Since a ready-to-assemble cabinet is shipped tightly packed in a cardboard box, it used 45% less packing material as a pre-assembled cabinet. In addition to less packing material, it takes up less space on a truck and you can fit over 250% more on a pallet (on a traditional pallet you can fit roughly 8 pre-assembled cabinets with packing materials without damaging them….. with RTA Cabinets you can fit as many as 20-25 cabinets on a pallet). The more product you can fit in a truck, the less fuel per product that is actually be consumed and less pollution being created.</p>

<p>As the environmental impact of every day products becomes a bigger and bigger issue, it is important to start searching for way to have your own positive impact on the environment. While there are numerous products in the construction industry that are eco-friendly, we wanted to highlight two products that have the biggest impact on your home</p>

    <p>Energy efficiency is not just about what we do at home and at work. Its what we do everywhere. Nowhere can we practice energy efficiency that in the way we travel. We can practice energy efficiency in the vehicle we choose and the way we drive it. Here are some tips on driving with energy efficiency in mind.</p>

<p>Perhaps the number one detriment to driving with energy efficiency is the practice of jack rabbiting. This is the practice of flying away from the stop sign or traffic light and driving aggressively. When you floor that gas pedal not only do you waste gas but you increase the rate of pollution drastically. Even one second of this type of gunning it driving can create almost the same amount of carbon dioxide being emitted as if you drive normally for 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Energy efficiency in driving is also about thinking ahead. Anticipating each stop so that you can let your car or truck coast down on its own is easier on the car as well as the ozone. Braking hard after a hard acceleration is not only a cause of increased air pollution but it also wears out your brakes and wastes gas.</p>

<p>Up to a certain point energy efficiency is helped by slower driving speeds. If you have a car whose dash indicates RPMs note when you are over 3000. That’s generally when you’ll start to see the difference in your gas mileage. For some cars this is 80mph on the straightaway, for others its 65mph.</p>

<p>There arent many things that work against energy efficiency as much as sitting in rush hour traffic. Of course, in some larger cities it always seems like rush hour. As much as possible avoid stop and go driving. This will increase your gas mileage and decrease your vehicles emissions of air pollutants.</p>

<p>If you can combine a number of small errands into one trip you can make a big difference in the pollution your car generates and the gas you use. This is because an engine and catalyst that is warmed up creates considerably less pollution.</p>

<p>Decreasing the heavy items you carry around in your vehicle can help your energy efficiency as well. Each 100 pounds your car or truck is hauling reduces its fuel economy approximately one percent.</p>

<p>For those who drive a manual transmission or an automatic vehicle with overdrive be aware of the fact that the higher the gear you are driving in the lower the cars RPMs, and thus the less fuel used for the same drive and the less wear on the engine. Manual vehicle transmissions should be shifted up as soon as possible, and automatics should be put in overdrive as soon as they hit 55 mph.</p>

<p>Air conditioning in vehicles is often necessary but it does increase fuel consumption and pollutants. Roll the car windows down, open the doors and air it out as much as you can before you turn on the air conditioning.</p>

<p>Follow these tips and you’ll greatly increase your vehicles energy efficiency.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Along with fuel efficiency, water conservation, and reduction in meat consumption, home composting is one of the most environmentally beneficial activities of modern society. Yard and food wastes make up approximately 30% of the waste stream in the US. Not only does composting successfully divert a significant portion of your family’s waste stream from the landfill and water treatment facilities, it is a natural method of recycling organic materials into valuable humus. Finished compost is nutritious enough to use as a soil amendment, buffering the pH and helping to retain water in the soil. It can cool the soil’s surface, and help mitigate erosion. Why buy topsoil when you create your own endless supply?</p>

<p>Home composting also serves as an invaluable educational tool, teaching youngsters about conservation, the cycle of life, and inter-connectedness of the natural world. If it gets your child thinking about science or biology, or voluntarily participating in gardening and yard work, isn’t it well worth the effort?</p>

<p>Like death and taxes, composting happens – whether we want it to or not. Though all organic matter will eventually decompose (despite neglect), the trick is to get your pile to decompose as fast as you can fill it. The rate at which breakdown occurs depends on several factors: oxygenation, temperature, water content, particulate surface area, and the carbon-nitrogen ratio. Like painting, composting is more art than a rigid science, and can at times require a bit of finesse and skill. However, with patience and a little practice, you can have ready-to-use humus for your garden in 6-8 weeks.</p>

  </header>

    <p>The holidays are approaching and children are busy getting their lists of gifts ready, as parents prepare to go shopping. Wonderful as the holidays are, it is a time to wonder how much our children appreciate what they have (and soon will get), how much they take things for granted and how often they share or provide charity for those less fortunate during the holidays.</p>

<p>What can you do so children appreciate what they have and not take things for granted? Start by taking a look at yourself as a parent. Check with yourself the reasons you buy the children things and how much you buy. For example, do you buy to reward good grades or behavior? Because it was pretty? Guilt of coming home too late? Guilt of being divorced and not seeing the children often enough? Because everyone else has it? It is the latest trend? Next, how do the children react when you give them the gift? Do they spend time playing with it? Do they put it on the side? Do they jump for joy? Do they even say thank you? The less they react, the less they play with it and how soon they get bored gives you a clue that you probably are buying too much. Finally, are you thanked and appreciated for the gesture? Teach the children to differentiate between their needs and wants. For example, their needs include shelter, food, education, clothing etc., and their wants are basically everything else.</p>

<p>What can you do during the holiday season? The first step is to teach children appreciation for the things that they already have. One way of doing this is taking out all the toys, games, music, DVD, stuffed animals, Nintendo, etc. that you have at home and place them in one room. I can almost guarantee that you as well as they will be shocked and surprised at how many things you have accumulated through the years. Then, sort them out in priorities. For example, which ones are necessary and they need; which ones they play more often with; which ones are really meaningful for the home; the incomplete and broken ones (that we mean to clean out and always forget) and last but not least, the ones they don’t use anymore (or might even have forgotten you had). Finally, come up with a list of charities to donate some of these things to. Pick out the charities with the children; let it be food, books, clothing, toys centers, hospitals, shelters, etc. Make it a joint process. This will help create a social conscience in the children, an awareness of their community and a sense of belonging. By doing this process, you have not only helped others less fortunate, but also your children in a process of growing up.</p>

    <p>Home gardening is tricky business. Do you wonder how can you get your garden to look like. Gardening information could easily help you to plan for gardening in front of your house.</p>

<p>Getting your plant respond well is in with your ability. Several general steps are involved, some of that you have been already doing can get the result you want.</p>

<p>The gardening is not and easy job and to maintain it is an another tricky subject. If you are planning to have to good flower and plant in front of your house, you have to plan the area, first draw the diagram of your lot. This map of hard-scape will be backbone of your plan.</p>

<p>Now start your gardening with adding the large shrubs and tree that are permanent fixture in your yard. Note their height, distinctive shade and sunny area. Mark where the shady area reach all this feature will influence your plant selection.</p>

<p>Now start selecting the plants according to your choice. Always remember that, you are the only one who will be looking at these plants and taking good care of them. So pick the plants which makes you happy and you will love to give more attention and care.</p>

<p>Most of the time we fail to maintaining our gardening it is not because you have not taken a good care of it. But while selecting the plants we only think of our choice and we pick that plant and forget to consider the specifics of soil type, temperature zone and climate that will dictate what plants do well in your area. It’s good to visit your garden center and look at catalogs for those plants that fill your needs.</p>

<p>Each kind of plant will have its own water need like frequency and amount of watering. For easier care, put plant with similar water requirement near to each other. Fertilizing plants will help plants to grow more fast and will not get damaged. Landscape plants respond very well to fertilizers that have a high percent of slow release organic nitrogen, which make sure that plants reach their full potential for deep, green color. Be sure to consider the condition of the root system.</p>

  </header>

    <p>A recent Finnish study followed over 24,000 citizens with no prior history of hypertension or high blood pressure for thirteen years to attempt to find a causal link between high blood pressure and coffee. The ages of the participants were between 25 and 64 years old. Also required was that they had no history of hypertension drug use and no history of stroke or heart disease.</p>

<p>The results of the study were inconclusive leaving it an open question as to how much coffee drinking affects hypertension.</p>

<p>During the course of the study, 2500 participants, or approximately 10%, began taking some type of anti hypertension drug. Previous studies have shown that roughly 19% of non-coffee drinkers developed high blood pressure during the time period of the study. Also, what’s unknown is how many of the participants developed high blood pressure but are either unaware of it or not taking medication for it.</p>

<p>Part of the questionnaire that participants were asked to complete focused on how many cups of coffee they drink daily. The more cups of coffee a participant drank, the greater the chances are that he or she would end up in the group taking anti hypertension drugs. So although there does seem to be some slight causation link between coffee drinking and high blood pressure, the risk seems to be small, and many questions still remain.</p>

<p>For example, coffee drinkers tend to drink alcohol more than non coffee drinkers. Though the occasional drink may be good for relieving stress and may even reduce diastolic blood pressure, studies have consistently shown that alcohol when consumed in excess increases blood pressure. We also know that over time, excess drinking can damage the heart. The study did not control for alcohol consumption.</p>

<p>Coffee drinkers also, as a rule, smoke cigarettes more than non smokers. Smoking tends to harden the blood arteries and constrict blood flow. The heart has to pump harder to force the blood through the narrow arteries and blood pressure rises as a result. In addition, studies have also demonstrated that discontinuing tobacco smoking will likely lead to a decrease in blood pressure. The study did not control for smoking.</p>

<p>Other lifestyle factors that come into play are eating habits, gender, weight, exercise, and salt sensitivity and intake. Diet, as we know, has a great impact on whether a person develops hypertension. Is a person who drinks coffee more likely to also have bad eating habits which can lead to high blood pressure?</p>

<p>Exercise is very beneficial to the heart and arterial system. Is a coffee drinker more likely to be sedentary than a non coffee drinker?</p>

<p>For years now, it seems as though every bit of food we put into our bodies is somehow harmful to us. Fish is good for the heart but are we willing to risk ingesting too much mercury. A vegetarian diet is good for health, but are we willing to risk bone loss? Fruits have loads of healthy antioxidants, but will the sugar content in them rot our teeth?</p>

<p>But there is one piece of good news from the study. It seems as though coffee drinking actually lowers the risk of getting type 2 diabetes. At this point, we’ll take all the good news we can get.</p>
