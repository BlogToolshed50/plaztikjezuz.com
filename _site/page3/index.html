  </header>

    <p>If you’re anything like me and the scent of something pleasant can instantly lift your mood, then a house that is pleasant smelling will be a constant lift-booster. Here are some ways to do it.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>As far as possible, keep unpleasant smells away from the house or at least away from the main living areas. Ask family members to leave smelly shoes outside. Ban smoking in your house. Make sure the toilet door is always closed. Empty the rubbish bin frequently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use sweet-smelling products while cleaning. Put talcum powder on the carpet before vacuuming. Put a drop of your favorite essential oil in buckets of water used to clean the floor. Make up your own cleaning products and add some of your favorite smells.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep a candle or an oil burner in every single room and use them. Burn some incense sticks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep clothes sweet smelling by putting slices of soap between them. Add a drop of your favorite essential oil to the laundry.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open windows as much as possible through the day. Plant flowers or sweet smelling shrubs near windows so that their scent carries indoors. Keep a vase of fresh flowers in the house.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cook often. Cook things that smell nice: bread, biscuits, tasty stews. If you don’t have the time to make them from scratch, buy packet mixtures.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

    <p>Foot care is essential, even for those vacationers relaxing at beaches and resorts. If taking the occasional walk on the beach or a leisurely swim in the ocean is the extent of your vacation activity, be sure to listen to your feet.</p>

<p>Foot-care tips</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Always wear shoes or sandals while walking on sand, in order to prevent foot injuries from hot sand and objects that may be hidden beneath the sand</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be sure to apply sunscreen to feet while basking in the sun; the skin on the feet is very sensitive and needs to be protected against the sun’s harmful rays</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When purchasing sandals, be sure to buy ones that are comfortable and have plenty of arch support to prevent common foot problems such as tired, achy feet and corns, calluses and blisters. If common foot problems do occur, be sure to relieve discomfort by using over-the-counter products to keep your feet healthy and happy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be sure to wear protection on your feet. Fungus infections, which are responsible for Athlete’s Foot, thrive in warm, moist environments including pool decks. If you already suffer from Athlete’s Foot use an over-the-counter anti-fungal cream once-a-day application, to eliminate the infection</p>
  </li>
</ul>

    <p>Instant Messaging is rapidly becoming accepted in the business community as a viable communications tool and process – it’s faster than e-mail, free on the client side, even a novice user can easily grasp the interface in just a few minutes and it enables remote workers and business partners to “talk” and share files and information effortlessly using the in-place infrastructure of the internet. Its mushrooming in popularity too – according to IDC, corporate and general business users will jump from 5.5M in 2001 to close to 200M.</p>

<p>What are some of the pitfalls and concerns you need to have when assessing and integrating Instant Messaging (“IM” another biz acronym) with your business processes? Be aware you are sending clear text messages over the public Internet – so all IM technology is inherently insecure. Privacy issues can also be raised – these messages are typically archived via the IM servers of the company whose services you are using and can be made public at a later date. Anyone with a network scanner may have access to and be reading your messages and if your are downloading files, you need to ensure your anti-virus software is setup to scan these files when you open them.</p>

<p>One of the biggest pitfalls of the technology and process is that it adds another communications layer to your busy day – but you can offset this by selecting or filtering who you communicate with at any point by using the IM interface to block all or selected individuals from “seeing” you when you are online.</p>

<p>Finally, like all things in today’s computer industry (or many) each of the Instant Messaging vendors are trying to build applications which don’t integrate with the other (no surprise here – arrogance has not faded away in the business community!). So, you need to assess the installed base of the market leaders and make a decision on which company’s product you want to utilized – my recommendation would be to review Microsoft’s or AOL/Time Warner’s products – their installed bases are in the 200 million users plus when combined (these numbers include consumer and business usage) and they both work well and have user interfaces that are intuitive.</p>

<p>There is one alternative company that is solving the “IM Tower of Babel” issues and claims to integrate well with all proprietary apps by utilizing XML technology, Jabber, Inc., www.jabber.com So, if interoptability is important to you then I would recommend assessing their products.</p>

<p>Most of the IM providers including Microsoft are integrating voice communications with their IM clients – you may be able to bypass your local telephone carrier at some point using this technology, but don’t bet on it anytime soon – all of those lobbyists here in the states need to keep generating fees on behalf of their telecom clients in Washington D.C. We use Microsoft’s IM product and we have upon occasion utilized the voice and video features (you must of course have a multimedia setup for your PC and camera) and they do work. Although the video quality is a little jerky and the voice is akin to the old Citizens Band (“CB”) radio – your Internet connectionmimpacts the quality of both.</p>

<p>Whose technology do you choose? There are some clear market leaders in the Instant Messaging marketing including Microsoft (no surprise here). But, like most Microsoft technology/tools you pay a price for the software/services, albeit a small one. You have to register with Microsoft’s NET Passport passport service which is designed to be a universal login – this only takes a few minutes but be forewarned they also try to get you to setup a Hot Mail account, but you can work around this.</p>

<p>The other dominant IM product is AOL’s ICQ product http://web.icq.com – it has similar functionality as Microsoft’s application. The original technology was developed by a great Israeli company, Mirabellis, Inc., subsequently acquired by AOL. My chief complaint with this product is the irritating banner ads that AOL keeps pushing at you when you are utilizing their product. But, it’s a small price to pay for a free product on the client side.</p>

<p>Yahoo also has an IM product (“Yahoo Messenger”) but I am not convinced this will stay as a core part of their business, as they appear to be still trying to figure out what they are going to become in the post “.com gold rush era” market; i.e. Portal, Directory, Media giant, software/services company, etc. And, they’ve certainly jettisoned parts of their business the last 12-18 months and I would wager they’ve had discussions about getting out of the IM business.</p>

<p>Finally, it is also quickly moving into other markets and devices including PDAs and Pagers – if you’re a real geek and you can’t stand to be out of touch while your in the shower and you have a water proof device you can ping away. But, I think we all need some down time for friends and family, but wanted to make sure I covered all possible bases with this column – until next time!</p>

  </header>

    <p>Do you remember as a child having to do something you really didn’t want to do because it was difficult?</p>

<p>Was it music lessons? Or dancing? Or some kind of sporting activity? I am sure you can remember something that your parents really wanted you to do, but you rebelled against!</p>

<p>With almost everyone there is something they tried, and failed to do as a child.</p>

<p>Can you remember how good you felt, when finally your parents gave into your demands and let you ‘give it up’, but that feeling didn’t last forever, did it?.</p>

<p>Ten or fifteen years later didn’t you look back and hate yourself, for making that decision to quit all those years ago?</p>

<p>Do you remember looking at your friends, the one or two who did continue, with envy at what they managed to achieve?</p>

<p>Don’t you remember thinking ‘that could have been me..’ Don’t you remember feeling angry with your parents for letting you give up, when you could have made a success of things, if you had just kept going when things got tough.</p>

<p>But it is easy to blame others for decisions made when you were young, and as a child you were too immature to see the big picture.</p>

<p>Yet as an adult there is no-one else to blame, and many adults take up things later on in life, everything from scuba diving to hang gliding, to internet marketing! But surprisingly, most people still give up after a short time.</p>

<p>But why? You would have thought that the benefits of maturity and hindsight would have told them to keep going.</p>

<p>Sadly the fact is most people give up on everything in life when it becomes difficult.</p>

<p>Most people, even as adults, can still not see the ‘Big Picture’. They fail because they do not like doing the mundane, boring and time consuming tasks, that everyone who has ever succeeded in anything has to do initially.</p>

<p>It they don’t achieve success immediately, they start to doubt themselves, and doubt that what they are doing will ever make them successful.</p>

<p>They can not make that leap of faith. Faith in themselves, and faith in what they are doing.</p>

<p>Today, in my new career helping people to make money on the internet, I see people trying to achieve financial independence, and it really saddens me when they give up after just a short time.</p>

<p>Most people start off by trying to go it alone, to teach themselves.</p>

<p>They get themselves a free affiliate/associate website, they then put in a few ads on free classified sites, and soon become disillusioned after failing to make any sales. Most quit at this stage.</p>

<p>Of the people left, some decide that it must be the product that is wrong, so they sign up for ten or twenty more free associate sites, but they then find that their problems are magnified ten or twenty times, since they now have to promote all of these different sites individually.</p>

<p>They put ten or twenty ads in the same free classified sites, but still end up with no sales. Most of these people then quit at this stage.</p>

<p>A few enlightened people however don’t give up. They look around for a ‘teacher’, or ‘mentor’. They look at the people who have become successful, and are making money, and they decide to learn off of them.</p>

<p>As a former teacher, I try to show people the correct way of doing things in order to succeed.</p>

<p>For example, contrary to what the companies themselves say, you will not make much money by directly promoting just one free affiliate site.</p>

<p>You need your own website, which has been professionally designed so that you can feature all of your programs at once. You then need to drive traffic to your one site, and there are lots of different ways of doing this.</p>

<p>Also, whatever you are selling, most people will not buy anything the first time, in fact they need to see the same thing seven or more times, before they decide to buy. You need an autoresponder system to keep reminding prospects over and over again about your products and services.</p>

<p>I explain to people that it is essential to remain in contact with your customers, so that they keep buying from you, and that you need to run a daily/weekly/monthly, newsletter or e-zine.</p>

<p>To do this you must have a list-server which allows you to send an e-mail to hundreds, or thousands of people all at once.</p>

<p>On my website I give away tons of FREE E-books and Software to help people succeed.</p>

<p>The point I always try to get across is that there is always a solution, to every problem, you just have to keep going until you find it.</p>

<p>Every single person who has ever been successful know this.</p>

<p>Problems are the food of success. Each problem or set back that you encounter, pushes you a bit closer towards achieving your goal!</p>

<p>Yes or course there is a lot to learn, but the average person with a bit of determination will succeed. Don’t ‘give up’ just because things occasionally get tough.</p>

<p>Remember the lesson you learnt as a child, if you give up now, then in a few years time you will be bitter and angry with yourself for not going the distance.</p>

<p>Just remember it is impossible to fail, as long as you keep on trying.</p>

<p>So why not look at things again? It’s not too late, even if you have ‘given up’ on the idea of making any serious money.</p>

<p>You owe it to yourself to make that leap of faith.</p>

<p>Start to believe in yourself, just one more time, and have faith in the people who really have made a success out of the internet, and want to help you succeed.</p>

    <p>According to Dr. Shaver, several lifestyle factors must be considered to benefit from a better night’s sleep. First, evaluate the sleep environment — ensure that your room is cool, dim and quiet. Reserve the bedroom for sleep — avoid bringing work to bed or watching television in the bedroom.</p>

<p>Next, allow enough time for sleep — on average, the National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recommends eight hours for adults. But, in the 2002 NSF “Sleep in America” poll, 39 percent of respondents said they were sleeping less than seven hours at night on weekdays. And most only slept 7.5 hours on the weekends.</p>

<p>Finally, ensure that each sleep partner is comfortable by finding a mattress that meets individual needs. According to the NSF, 91 percent of people say their sleep surface is important in helping them get a deep, restful night’s sleep. And 89 percent of those surveyed in 2002 agree that a better quality mattress provides a better night’s sleep.</p>

<p>One alternative to traditional innerspring mattresses is The Sleep Number Bed by Select Comfort. It allows individuals to adjust the bed to their ideal level of personal comfort — their Sleep Number. A Sleep Number is a number between zero and 100 that represents each individual’s ideal setting for mattress firmness, comfort and support. With dual-adjustable air chambers, sleep partners can independently adjust the firmness on their side of the Sleep Number bed without disrupting their partner’s desired comfort level.</p>

<p>Kevin Garnett, professional basketball player for the Minnesota Timberwolves, has recognized the importance of sleep on his overall performance as a professional athlete and has taken personal sleep comfort to a new level. In 2001, the 6-foot, 11-inch forward ordered a custom-made 9-foot by 9-foot, dual-adjustable Sleep Number bed from Select Comfort.</p>

<p>“The Sleep Number bed has helped me sleep through the night when my muscles ache after a hard workout,” says Garnett. “With a regular mattress you have to adjust your body to the bed. The Sleep Number bed allows you to adjust the bed to your body.”</p>

<p>In studies conducted at Stanford University and Duke University, participants fell asleep faster and experienced better quality, more restorative sleep on the Sleep Number bed than on a traditional innerspring mattress. Stanford University researchers also found that 87 percent of those who slept on the Sleep Number bed experienced a greater percentage of REM sleep with fewer disturbances. The Sleep Number bed also provides more proper spinal alignment and 93 percent of participants reported back pain relief.</p>

  </header>

    <p>According to Family Services Canada, approximately 12% of children are bullies. Additional research confirms that bullying occurs frequently: once every seven minutes on the playground and once every twenty-five minutes in class.</p>

<p>To prevent bullying, it is important to consider not only the bully and victim, but also peers, school staff, parents, and the broader community. The best approach at school, is to develop a clearly stated code of behavior with consistent follow-through.</p>

<p>All school staff should participate in educational sessions, together with parent and student representatives. Once adults learn to recognize problem behavior and how to stop it, they can supervise and intervene more successfully.</p>

<p>Parent meetings and newsletters should address the problems of bullying. Parents need to talk to their children about bullying and look for signs of potential victimization.</p>

<p>Communication between parents and school is essential, as parents are often the first to find out that their children are being bullied. Peers also play a critical role in the prevention of bullying. If students are taught how to intervene appropriately, or get adult assistance, and to empathize with victims and condemn aggression, bullying can be reduced.</p>

<p>Bullies and victims require individual attention. Bullies should be told that their behavior is not acceptable and that they will suffer consequences established in the code of behavior. If a group of children are being bullied, bullies and bystanders should be brought to task. Victims need to be encouraged to speak up and ensured that their school will protect them from further harassment. Parents of bullies should be informed of their child’s behavior and enlisted to discipline the behavior and mentor their child to help prevent further occurrences of bullying or victimization.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Finding happiness is easier than you might think. Happiness is all around us, and all we have to do is hop in the car and hit the road to find it. Actually, there is more to true happiness than just jumping in the car, but for many people, self-actualization does involve discovering new places, new cultures, beautiful nature and secret little hideaways. Kathleen Walls, publisher of American Roads Magazine, and David Leonhardt, publisher of Your Daily Dose of Happiness share a few of their favorite “Happy Trails,” hoping you, too, will find happiness there.</p>

<p>MOJAVE DESERT</p>

<p>For a Canadian, snow is no big deal. This year, we’ve been shoveling it since early November. But to find snow in a desert, that really made my eyes pop. It was noon, and it had rained in Palm Springs, California, the previous evening. But the famous Mojave Desert is actually quite high up in the mountains, and the rain fell there as snow. Just how amazing was it to see snow tucked up against the north side of a cactus? Amazing enough that, through my jet lag, I delivered a mostly impromptu speech on the sighting at my Toastmasters club.</p>

<p>If you want to see snow sidling up to a cactus – what a photo op! – head for the desert in January or February, and make sure to choose a desert with a high altitude. The Mojave Desert proved most effective for this. Now, should I mention the Joshua trees?</p>

<p>YELLOWKNIFE</p>

<p>It really is hard to fill one’s eyes with wonder, what with Star Wars and The Lord of The Rings and so many special effects that make a person just want to yawn. Then, every now and then, one comes across something truly unique, something that actually does make your eyes pop with wonder. Such is Yellowknife, a town built on a peninsula of rock in the Arctic. What is unique about this town are the houses in the old city. There are some amazing mansions hoisted up on the rock. Well, at least some corners are on the rock. Others are on stilts one or two stories high. Each house is unique, and so are the various contraptions to keep them level on this uneven land. (Why would anybody choose this spot to settle in the first place, with so much flat land all around?)</p>

<p>The second amazing feature is the shanty-town shacks scattered among the mansions. In every other city, the slums and the ritzy parts of town are separate, but not in Yellowknife. I found that a truly stereotype- shattering sight.</p>

<p>LUSK CAVERNS, GATINEAU PARK</p>

<p>Happiness is spelunking. Let’s face it, you’ve done a million vacations on the road and in the air and on the water. How many have you done underground? Two, in my case. Once in Pennsylvania on a boat, and once in Gatineau Park, in Quebec.</p>

<p>If you think of a cave as something cavernous, these don’t qualify. The two caves are merely a passage for a stream that flows underground for a few yards. The first cave is just right for little children, who can wade in the gently-flowing water.</p>

<p>The second cave is a little more challenging, as the water pools into a miniature underground lake. In the spring, when the water is high, there’s not much room for a head to pass between the water and the roof of the cave. Of course, you have to be daring to brave the cold spring water. June is a great time to visit; by August there’s not as much water. And can there be anything happier than splashing in water while exploring a cave? Happiness is watching the sunrise over Mobile Bay. And what better time to visit the city by the bay than Mardi Gras, when the historic city puts on it’s party face. This traditional celebration was brought to Mobile by the French even before it was established in New Orleans. That history is preserved at the Mardi Gras Cottage Museum located on the grounds of Oakleigh, an antebellum mansion located in the historic section of this fun city. Centuries of Mardi Gras history are packed into this little cottage. Be sure to visit Oakleigh while you are there. In fact Mobile is packed with great historic sites from the French Fort Conte to the U.S.S Alabama, These sites have been carefully preserved or restored</p>

<p>Take time away from the celebrating to visit Bellingrath Gardens and home, Dauphin Island Sea Lab, Weeks Bay Preserve, and Mobile Botanical Gardens (which will introduce you to the ecological diversity of Mobile as well). Then there are all of those parades. All of which are guaranteed to make you feel good.</p>

<p>MACON GEORGIA: SPORTS HALL OF FAME INDUCTION</p>

<p>For some people, sports equate happiness. The Georgia Sports Hall of Fame’s 46th Induction Class, which will be held February 7-8 2003, will includes two female pioneers, arguably baseball’s greatest home run hitter, one of football’s best place kickers, a Peach State high school coaching legend, and one of Georgia’s most celebrated golfers.</p>

<p>Georgia Sports Hall of Fame is the newest of Macon’s attractions housing memorabilia of pro and amateur athletes in all fields. You can even experience the thrill of driving in a Nascar event without the danger. Climb into a race-car and take the wheel in a fast paced race. Hear the sound when you ram the fence. Experience the thrill of the track. Then get the results of your foray into professional race-car driving. Depending on how well you drive, the results may or my not make you happy. The museum is sure to be a crowd pleasure for sports fans and non-fans alike</p>

<p>FORT VALLEY GEORGIA: FESTIVALOF CAMELLIAS</p>

<p>Flowers are a sure mood lifter, so don’t miss the Festival of Camellias at Massee Lane Gardens in Fort Valley Georgia encompasses the entire month of February when camellia blooms are at their peak.(Something is out of place in this sentence.) The flowers begin to show color in October and continue through late March.</p>

<p>Not only camellias show their beautiful faces here. Each season provides a new delight for the eyes with roses, flowering bulbs, day lilies and much more. Even the path winding throughout the gardens is unusual. Scattered randomly through it you will find ancient millstones gathered from middle Georgia. Also along the path you spot granite mile stones from the Old Wire Road witch ran from New Orleans to Washington, D. C. The road was so named because it was the route of the first telegraph lines in the southeast.</p>

<p>After you have absorbed nature’s outdoor offerings, visit the two museums housing the largest public collection of Boehm Porcelains. Here you will find nature reproduced so exquisitely you will sometimes think you are looking on a live bird or a blooming flower.</p>

<p>ATHENS GEORGIA: TASTE OF ATHENS</p>

<p>Food is sure to make everyone happy and Taste of Athens, a community fund raiser, is sure to make you feel good all over. You get to sample all of the exotic restaurants Athens Georgia abounds in all under on roof and contribute to a good cause at the same time this February 23th.</p>

<p>Athens’ restaurants are hard to beat both in number and in excellent cuisine. Harry Bissett’s New Orleans Cafe and Oyster Bar, where you experience the ambience as well as the authentic food of “The Big Easy”. It’s housed in an old bank building and the mellow brick walls are reminiscent of some of the French Quarter’s courtyard restaurants. The majority of the food served here is spicy, for example The Blackened Redfish, gumbo and Crawfish Etoffee, but there are enough less heated dishes to suit any taste. Any festival that brings all of these culinary delights together makes me happy.</p>

<p>It looks like for David, happiness is scenery, and for Kathleen, it’s festivals. Whatever it is about traveling that turns you on, now’s the time to hit the trail. So “Happy Trails to you until we meet again.</p>
