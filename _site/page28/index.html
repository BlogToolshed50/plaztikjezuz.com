  </header>

Many reservoirs built in various countries help in producing this hydro power apart from storing water for the irrigation purpose. It up to the Governments to go in for more numbers of reservoirs to enhance the production of hydro power.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Meditation refers to a state where your body and mind are consciously relaxed and focused. Practitioners of this art report increased awareness, focus, and concentration, as well as a more positive outlook in life.</p>

<p>Meditation is most commonly associated with monks, mystics and other spiritual disciplines. However, you don’t have to be a monk or mystic to enjoy its benefits. And you don’t even have to be in a special place to practice it. You could even try it in your own living room!</p>

<p>Although there are many different approaches to meditation, the fundamental principles remain the same. The most important among these principles is that of removing obstructive, negative, and wandering thoughts and fantasies, and calming the mind with a deep sense of focus. This clears the mind of debris and prepares it for a higher quality of activity.</p>

<p>The negative thoughts you have – those of noisy neighbors, bossy office-mates, that parking ticket you got, and unwanted spam– are said to contribute to the ‘polluting’ of the mind, and shutting them out is allows for the ‘cleansing’ of the mind so that it may focus on deeper, more meaningful thoughts.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Time marches on and so do we. Before we know it, we are older and so are our parents or loved ones. Caring for them and being sure their needs are met become a prime concern especially when they begin to not be able to care for themselves as they used to. This dilemma touches most every family. The thing to avoid is to remain under a veil of ignorance by not understanding your options and waiting until the last minute to make an abrupt and often uniformed decision. Care for the elderly is of utmost importance. This will be addressed in a comparison between adult day care, assisted living, and nursing home care.</p>

<p>Adult day care has the shortest care periods and usually lasts up to 8 hours a day and 5 days a week. People with Alzheimer’s, the feeble, the physically handicapped, those infected with dreaded diseases, people with declining brain function and the hearing and visually impaired are included in this type of care. It serves as respite for busy caregivers and offers social and recreational activities, meals, therapy, health and social services. Usually there is an assessment made of the needs of each person before they enter the program. It is also important to find out how physically able they are because adult day care does provide rehabilitative services and personal care. One of its greatest advantages is that it helps people remain independent and be able to live with loved ones as long as they can plus it gives caregivers the break they often need</p>

  </header>

    <p>Every nation has been craving for the globalization over the past decade and achieved certain advantages by resorting to the principle of globalization. It ensured the greater movement of goods, people, capital and even ideas due to the increased trade and investment. The globalization has led to a board members less trade and world. Economic boom was achieved by many countries through the opening achieved by globalization and the exports and imports could show tremendous progress. Many countries could reduce the poverty level with the increased GDP and trade surplus due to the globalization.</p>

<p>On the other side of the picture there were certain social and economic costs the nations were compelled to pay on account of the globalization. The trade liberalization achieved through the globalization rewarded the competitive industries while the weaker and non competitive industries and trades were punished owing to the price war. Increased travels and trade because of the opening has led to the spread of various dreaded diseases for both human and animals. In fact, the interdependence of the countries on the economic front resulted in various financial crisis as witnessed in Asia during 2008. In all the nations should wake up to the call and regulate the aspect of globalization to reap more benefits for the humans rather than inviting unwarranted rivalry and issues.</p>

  </header>

    <p>The scientific invention goes unabated due to the inquisitiveness of the researchers to explore the world to the core. The recent news from NASA has revealed the presence of the relatively small planets and stable multi planet systems which are more plentiful than the previous searches showed. Latest data from the Kepler telescope on more than 1000 possible new planets outside our solar system actually doubled the count of what our astronomers call as exoplanets. They have not been confirmed as the planets yet, but some astronomers estimate that 90 percent of what Kepler has found will eventually verified. Kepler was launched since 2009 and has been conducting the census since then to find out the presence of earth like planets.</p>

<p>It has found there are more planets that are much smaller than Jupiter than the giant planets. Some of these planets even found to approach the size of the earth. It gives an indication that they are potential planets for living creatures. Yale University exoplanet expert Debra Fischer confirmed the fact that there is eventual hope for worlds that could harbor life. With the increasing population and the dearth of the scarce resources on earth, the ambition of the humans to find the alternative planet to live may become a reality since the findings of Kepler goes in the right direction as say by many experts in this field. Though Mother Earth has very thing to meet the need of every one of us, it looks insufficient to meet our greed. Hence, the search for the alternative will continue forever.</p>

  </header>

    <p>In the recent biggest high tech fair CeBit, people have found themselves bumping into “Jazz” a tele-presence robot also ambling around the vast expo. It is created by the French firm Gostai, and is a shiny white humanoid robot that its makers believe could transform business meetings and reduce the need for long distance travel. Controllable by anyone with access to the internet via a laptop or even smart phone, Jazz projects its user’s presence, showing his or her face on its own face and speaking in its user’s voice. Launched only two months ago, “Jazz” could easily deputies for a manager in a business meeting, or tour a factory or shop floor, both recording and beaming back what it seems to its user according the company source.</p>

<p>The main advantage over teleconferencing is its mobility anywhere which makes the job easier. In fact, the company is coming out with a more sleeker version of the same which will be user-friendly. It can run for five straight hours at around four kilometers per hour without the need for recharge. This robot, quiet and faceless, can be programmed to prowl around a factory or warehouse and alert the authorities if it detects people up to no good. In the present context of reduced margin and the various factors involved in the mobility of the people to attend to the business needs the creation of such type of robots will go a long way to help the business houses to maximize their profit.</p>
