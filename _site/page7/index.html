      <a class="post-link" href="/2014/02/12/calming-tips-for-hyperactive-children/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Calming Tips for Hyperactive Children</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Parents of hyperactive children know the “Would you please just settle down?!” phrase well, and likely use it on a regular basis.</p>

<p>There are a number of tips to help parents settle their hyperactive child down. These quick tips and relaxation techniques take the same amount of time as yelling and scolding but produce incredibly different results in hyperactive children.</p>

<p>Quick Calming Tips:</p>

<p>Try quick tips to calm a hyperactive child down during temper outbursts or unusually rowdy days. These calming tips are not novel to adults by any stretch. How many times have you heard “Take a deep breath and count to 10″ or “Calgon, take me away.” What works for big people works for little people as well._ Deep breathing is one of the simplest ways to calm the body. Teach your children to take deep breaths (in through the nose, out through the mouth) when they begin to feel frustrated and out of control. Parents, you do this too!</p>

<p>_ Draw a warm salt bath or bubble bath to wash away the hyperactive child’s stresses of the day.</p>

<p>_ Take your hyperactive child for a walk or send them around the block on their own if they are old enough. Not only does walking burn off excess energy, the repetitive thump, thump, thump of feet hitting pavement brings the mind back into focus.</p>

<p>_ Give your hyperactive child a mini-massage. Touch is very important to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder children. Massaging their temples, giving a shoulder rub or lightly running your fingers through their hair can calm children quickly.</p>

<p>_ Put together a “Boredom Box” that provides creative outlets for your hyperactive child. Fill this box or plastic storage bin with paint sets, coloring books, crossword puzzles, modeling clay, jewelry making kits and other artistic areas of interest. Hyperactive children bore easily and their fast spinning minds need extra stimulation. In the absence of nothing better to do, hyperactive children will lean on their own devises and you don’t want them doing that. Better that they draw than set the cat on fire…</p>

<p>The quick-fix calming techniques work to sooth the hyperactive child after they already became too stressed or active. There are also techniques that parents can teach their hyperactive children to help them get the “stuff” out before it builds up and explodes.</p>

<p>Create a calming home environment:</p>

<p>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder children have difficulty remaining calm in a hectic environment. Clearing the clutter and taking a “less is more” approach to decorating can reduce the sensory overload on Attention Deficit and hyperactive children.</p>

<p>The Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder child’s bedroom especially should be free of clutter. Use plastic bins to organize and store all those precious little plastic treasures (that we adults commonly refer to as “junk”) and small toys. Open the curtains to provide natural lighting. Keep posters and wall hangings to a minimum. Paint the child’s bedroom in calming muted colors instead of bright primary colors.</p>

<p>If you play music in the house, opt for soft “elevator music” or classical music instead of rock. Try to avoid loud clatters and noises when your Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder child is at home.</p>

<p>Follow a Routine:</p>

<p>All children thrive in homes that provide routines, consistency and structure. Attention Deficit and hyperactive children especially need structure and schedules to feel secure in their surroundings. For these children, a more “military” approach to routines works better. Waking up, eating meals, doing homework, and bed times should all occur at about the same time every day, with few surprises to upset the Attention Deficit or hyperactive child.</p>

<p>A Place to Relax:</p>

<p>If at all possible, find a space in the house to designate as a relaxation space. It does not have to be a large space but it does need to be away from high activity areas. This little corner (or even a portion of a walk-in closet) can have a beanbag chair and a few books, coloring books or other quiet time activities.</p>

<p>Encourage your child to go to this space when they become angry or out of control, but never make this a place of punishment. This special spot in the house is a positive place where they can go to settle down, sort things out or just hang out when they need to be alone.</p>

<p>Journalism:</p>

<p>For the child who is old enough to write, journalism is an excellent way to untangle frazzled minds and get things off their chest. This technique allows hyperactive children to spill their internal stresses outside themselves and onto paper.</p>

<p>Develop a daily habit of having your child write a page or two, depending on their age, about anything that comes to mind. They can write “I hate school, the dog just drooled, the baby’s crying is driving me crazy…” – whatever comes to mind. Eventually, they will get to the guts of what is going on inside them. Then rumple or tear the paper up and throw it away.</p>

<p>These private internal thoughts are not for you or anyone else to read, ever. Please respect their privacy and let them know they can write anything down without fear of reprimand.</p>

<p>Taking a mini-vacation with Guided Imagery:</p>

<p>Guided imagery is a powerful relaxation tool for hyperactive children that pulls their focus to positive thoughts, all the while encouraging creativity in your child. You can check out books on this technique at your local library if you want further information on the subject.</p>

<p>Last, but certainly not least, diet:</p>

<p>Some parents find that reducing or eliminating sugar from the diet goes a long way in calming the hyperactive child. If your child is a finicky eater, you will need to supplement the diet to make sure your Attention Deficit or hyperactive child has the fuels needed for his body to function well.</p>

<p>Starting the day out with a healthy breakfast balanced with proteins, fats and carbohydrates is important. An egg sandwich, peanut butter toast and fresh fruit, protein shakes and fresh fruit smoothies are great ways to start the day for Attention Deficit and hyperactive children.</p>

<p>Sugar cereals are quick and convenient but should not be used as a breakfast mainstay. Fruit juices are high in calories and sugar and not recommended for children, especially those with Attention Deficit or hyperactivity. Instead of juice or sodas, get in the habit of offering plain old H2O. With plenty of bottled waters that offer fruit flavors and vitamin enhancements, getting your children hydrated is easier now than ever before.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2014/01/28/healthy-and-happy-feet-while-travelling/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Healthy and Happy Feet While Travelling</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Whether hiking in Canada’s Rocky Mountains or admiring art in Paris, traveling takes its toll on the feet, and sore feet can ruin the pleasure of a vacation.</p>

<p>Toby Saltzman is a freelance travel writer and editor, her globe-trotting job takes her to destinations around the world and requires her to spend countless hours on her feet, visiting various tourist and cultural attractions.</p>

<p>After years of experience caring for and treating her feet, some basic tips on how to keep feet healthy and happy, no matter where travelers adventure to this summer.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Wear comfortable walking or athletic shoes</li>
</ol>

<p>It may sound simple, but wearing comfortable shoes is essential when spending hours of vacation time on your feet. Comfortable shoes can help to alleviate the discomfort caused by corns and calluses and help to prevent blisters.</p>

<p>For those travelers with corns and calluses, plan to see your podiatrist before embarking on your trip. You may wish to ease the discomfort by packing over-the-counter cushion treatments to protect feet while on vacation. Blisters are one of the most common traveling foot injuries. Avoid missing out on enjoyable vacation excursions by using over-the-counter treatments to help heal and prevent blisters.</p>

<p>In addition, comfortable shoes with proper arch support delay the occurrence of tired, achy feet, a common culprit that hampers the enjoyment of much anticipated travel activities, such as hiking. Many over-the-counter insoles and devices can improve the arch support of a shoe, allowing for more “on your feet” time during a vacation.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do not pack shoes that need to be “broken in”</li>
</ol>

<p>Always avoid shoes that require a break-in period and instead, purchase shoes that feel comfortable right away. This also applies to packing for a vacation. If the shoes hurt your feet at home, they’ll hurt them on the road as well. Always be conscious of how vigorous the vacation activity is and how comfortable your shoes are.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If shoes do not have sufficient padding or support, improve the performance of your shoes by adding inserts/devices</li>
</ol>

<p>Quite often the shoes that “best match” a vacation outfit – whether for an afternoon shopping in New York City or an evening of entertainment on a cruise ship – are not beneficial to our foot health. Wear shoes that support feet, allowing for ease of movement wherever your vacation adventure may take you. For additional support, there are a variety of over-the-counter inserts that provide additional cushioning and support.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Soak feet nightly</li>
</ol>

<p>Treating feet each night with a specially designed soak such as foot bath will help to ease the discomfort of tired, achy feet. It also moisturizes and softens corns, calluses and rough, hard skin; a luxurious comfort that can be enjoyed in the privacy of a hotel room that will prepare your feet for a comfortable travel adventure the following day.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Moisturize and exfoliate feet</li>
</ol>

<p>Moisturizing and exfoliating feet can help to reduce the build up of dead skin that results in corns and calluses. It is also a nice, relaxing treat at the end of a long day of sight-seeing.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2014/01/22/how-to-get-a-good-nights-sleep/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">How To Get A Good Night&#8217;s Sleep!</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Do you remember when you were little and it seemed as though sleep overcame you as soon as your head hit your pillow? And you slumbered through the night until morning time? They call it the sleep of the innocent, but don’t you wish you could sleep like that again?</p>

<p>Adult responsibilities, stress, lifestyle and other worries often result in poor sleep habits and once the cycle of tossing and turning begins, it is difficult to return to a decent night’s sleep. Many adults rely on prescription drugs to fall asleep and quite a few are addicted to them! Others ‘self medicate’ and use alcohol and other recreational drugs to try and fall asleep. If you are regularly struggling to sleep well, then you probably need to learn to fall asleep again!</p>

<p>So let’s go back to basics!</p>

<p>And who better to consult than babies! After all babies are the experts at sleeping so why not learn a little from them! Apart from their age and body clock, there are specific reasons that babies fall asleep so well. Let’s have a look at a few of them and see if we can’t borrow some of the tricks!</p>

<p>ROUTINE: Most parents try very hard to get their children into a routine. Regular bedtimes, bath times and mealtimes are something to strive towards. Of course, one cannot be too rigid, but a child on a regular routine will feel secure and will be able to predict his environment more easily. It also helps his body clock to start the process of winding down before he actually gets to bed. He knows that after supper comes his bath, a story, a prayer and a good night kiss. When his head hits the pillow, he is ready to meet the sandman!</p>

<p>So try and follow this example. Start a night time routine. Make your evenings more or less predictable along the lines of supper, bath and bed. For at least three weeks try and follow this simple routine and go to bed at the same time each night about 8 hours before it is time to get up. Wear soft comfortable and cozy nightwear, specifically for sleeping.</p>

<p>EXERCISE: This is something kids do lots of! They don’t stop running around for a minute! Now I am not suggesting that you start running around wherever you go, but regular exercise is one of the best sleep aids around! It’s also free and healthy and has lots of good side effects. Take up a sport, go to the gym or start regular walks. You won’t regret it!</p>

<p>HAVE PEACEFUL EVENINGS: How many times don’t you hear parents saying to their kids Calm down now, it’s nearly bed time. Or You’d better stop running around you won’t be able to fall asleep! Perhaps you say this to your own children with good reason! Do you follow your own advice? Or do you sit up watching thrillers (or even worse the news!) or finishing off the day’s work that you brought home from the office? Sound familiar? Try a different approach. Never watch TV while trying to fall asleep. Rather dim the lights while you get into a hot bath and put on some soothing music. Use aromatherapy in your home in particular lavender for it’s soporific properties. Be quiet and peaceful for the hour before you go to bed and your body will start to get the message!</p>

<p>OTHER HINTS: Avoid all products with caffeine or sugar after 6pm. That means coffee, cola chocolate and all ‘soda pops’ (fizzy drinks). Also stay away from heavy meals at night. Your tummy will be too busy digesting to allow you to sleep well! Don’t eat red meat, refined products or lots of cheese. Go for pastas, grains, pulses, potatoes and rice. Good evening or bedtime drinks are warm milk, lettuce extract and chamomile tea (sleepy tea) – all safe and proven sleep aids. You will be surprised at the difference they make! Should you do this faithfully and still struggle to sleep, consult your doctor</p>

  </header>

    <p>In life, there tend to be ups and downs. When you are down, you have to keep yourself motivated and bring yourself up again. Negative thoughts, if excessive may sometimes affect a person’s self esteem. For example, you feel that you are not being acknowledged in the office and you get bored of working. This happens to almost anyone. Discouragement and lack of motivation will hinder you from focusing on your objective. Here are some methods I personally use to keep myself motivated, which I use over and over again.</p>

<p>Try having visual goals, something solid, and something material. Big dreams like owning a bigger house, a better car or a holiday of your dreams. Better still if you stick the picture of the house or car or holiday destination in your work station or cubicle. It keeps you sane under that tremendous work stress. When you have something to look forward to, the willpower will come naturally.</p>

<p>Do a to-do-list. It can be single item or many items, with or without expiry date. Researchers say that when tasks are easier accomplished when written down. It’s like a contract with yourself and contracts are meant to be honored. Having a to-do-list posted on the fridge is so much more effective than just remembering it mentally. Start a list today.</p>

<p>Small rewards can make real big difference too. Tell your friends and family you have achieved some of your plans. I am sure they are more than willing to give you small praises and keep you motivated. You can also reward yourself when partially achieve one major task. For example, if you plan to lose 10kg, buy yourself a new dress when you lost 5kg. By doing so, you will look forward to losing the remaining 5kg.</p>

<p>The last method I would like to share is reading motivational books. Walk into a book store or search for an e-book online. Motivational books need not to be in the form of lectures or pure methodology. There are some in the form of real life examples. I find the latter more inspiring and encouraging. Reading about others’ successes make me realized it sometimes achieving success is easier than you thought.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Students of metaphysical philosophy, theologians, and gurus all have rather strong opinions on the subject of giving. Many ask if it’s a law needing to be observed, while others believe that it is a virtue of kindness which will bestow goodness on them wherever they walk because they choose to be givers. Which is it? Is it a Law or is it optional. The answer is it is both and more.</p>

<p>Some want to know if it will make them a better person, while others believe that what they give will aide to the development of humanity. As different philosophies and Spiritual paths have varying ideas on what giving should be, the common thread in all Spiritual Beliefs is, give as it is purposed in your heart, knowing and believing that it is better to give than to receive.</p>

<p>A person does not have to be particularly altruistic in their beliefs to partake in the wonders and miracles of giving. It is better to have a good attitude and kind heart when giving, but there are rewards for the person who chooses to abide by the Law of Giving, simply because it is a Law and they have experienced the rewards of obeying the Law.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are those individuals who would rather know what it is that they are going to be out of. Often times these particular people, give with strings attached. This is the wrong attitude to take. You don’t have to be a perfect, flawless, and selfless human being to give, but what you must realize is that your rewards may not come from the person you supplied your goodness to. And those that respect the Law of Giving have come to realize that giving places them in a far greater position of always having more than enough because they have blessed humanity out of their excess.</p>

<p>Here are 3 Golden Keys of Giving that will assist you in understanding how this powerful Universal Law operates.</p>

<p>Golden Key #1: The Key Of Compassion</p>

<p>Giving comprises all good. Sometimes in life, people need to receive more than money. Sometimes, people need more than just material things to fill a void. For example, a man may be feeling lonesome, to the point of suicide. That individual may have just lost their entire family to some tragic accident. He becomes embittered and put off with life and decides things would be better for him, if he ended his life. He goes to a bridge, climbs over the rail and is about to jump. Suddenly a young girl sees this man in distress runs over to him and begs him not to jump and then offers him a check for $500.00…What? Guess what, the man will more than likely JUMP. Why? Because, the last thing he needed was a check for $500.00. He needed someone who he believed cared for him. He needed to be reminded of the precious gift of life and that his existence mattered.</p>

<p>Golden Key #2: The Key Of Currency</p>

<p>In another example, a struggling mother of four has just been notified that she will be evicted from her home, if her rent is not paid. A good neighbor friend of hers talks to the woman about her woes. This neighbor is a somewhat financially well off individual. After talking to the mother about her financial burden, she offers to bake the woman her favorite cake, so her and the children could have something sweet to eat…What? You do not have to be Freud to know that the last thing the woman needed was a cake? In this case, she needed some money.</p>

<p>Golden Key #3: The Key Of Love &amp; Devotion</p>

<p>A young girl arrives home after school only to face her parents arguing over her grades. Burdened with overwhelming emotion of pain and disappointment; the teen retreats to her room the remainder of the evening. Neither one of the girl’s parents bothered to check on her or to discuss her progress in school with her. What the young girl needed from her parents was devotion, reassurance, and sometimes all people need for a time is a hug.</p>

<p>Staying flexible, being open to change, and looking for opportunities to give whatever is needed is a wonderful and miraculous way to operate in the flow of the Abundance of Giving. You may not necessarily receive what you need from the person you gave to, but give anyway. As Mother Teresa once said, it is between you and God anyway.</p>
