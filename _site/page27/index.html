  </header>

    <p>The objective of using renewable energy in the aviation sector seems to become a reality when we come across the news that a flight has run on solar energy for 13 hours. The international flight from Payerne in Western Switzerland landed at Brussels airport after a 13 hour of flight energized by the solar cells. Though the speed was 10 times lesser than that of a commercial flight of modern days, the day may not be far-off to stabilize the speed.</p>

<p>The flight was operated with 12000 solar cells and could complete the mission successfully. In fact, the research continues to improve upon the system and to ensure that the solar operated flights are put in to commercial use to avoid the pollution and to reduce the cost of operation after proper system. More such attempts should be made to use the natural resources.</p>

    <p>In any business and more so in the financial concerns, the bottom line the extent of the perfection and efficiency with which the business is managed. One among the ratios that vouches for the efficiency of the management is the cost-income ratio. As the word indicates, it is the ratio between the operating expenses and the operating income of the business house or the industry.</p>

<p>In case the ratio is less, it indicates that the cost is less and the income is more benefiting the shareholders. If it is on the reverse, then it speaks badly about the management. The cost includes the expenses of the salary, fixed assets and all other operating expenses. Periodical review of the strategy followed by the financial and other institutions help them take appropriate and timely corrective steps to improve the efficiency of the management and keep the ratio at a lower level.</p>

  </header>

    <p>With the advent of various electronic gadgets like television, mobile phones and much more we come across people deprived of their sleep in the night. It is scientifically studied that watching to the television and working on the laptop every evening before going to sleep and playing video games late into the night or checking e-mails and text messages before turning off the lights could be interfering with the people’s sleep habits. This is found to be due to the exposure to artificial light before going to bed can increase alertness and suppress the release of melatonin, a sleep-promoting hormone.</p>

<p>It is a matter of great concern that the various modern day so-called useful gadgets including the cell phones and computers, which make our lives more productive and enjoyable, maybe abused to the point that they contribute to getting less sleep at night leaving millions functioning poorly the next day in their office. Almost 95 percent of people questioned in a recent study has revealed that they used some type of electronics in the hour before going to bed, and admitted they do not get enough sleep during the week. It is better that we use them with these aspects in mind and lead a healthy life with judicious use.</p>

    <p>No matter how great may be your ability to read and understand books, that growth, that law, require time as well as intelligent effort. No matter how poor may be your ability in such respect, that growth is absolutely certain if you put reasonable time and genuine effort into its acquisition.</p>

<p>The giant trees of California were once puny saplings. The slow lapse of time has drawn nature into their mighty hearts. Magnetism can no more be acquired by the mere reading an article, or by hurried practice of its directions, than can these giants of the West be produced in the hot-house culture of a northern summer.</p>

<p>Magnetic growth is naturally slow. Its principles, its methods, and the results of its study, have to be deeply sunk into and absorbed and assimilated by the subjective self before the reaction of magnetism in the objective life can obtain. If you have read these lines correctly, you have learned that magnetic growth cannot be hurried. These statements are placed here because, had they appeared at the beginning of our work, the outlook would have seemed, perhaps, discouraging, but more especially because they would not have been understood. You now understand them because you have toiled, and you can afford to smile at such possible discouragement. You have paid an easy price for magnetic power, for the gains discount the pains.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Although we cannot actually make our memory as powerful as one with a photographic memory, we can at least improve its processes so that we can recall more names than we usually do. This is especially true with people who are already aging. As we grow older, our memory slips. This is why most of our grandfathers and mothers often forget a lot of things, even our names.</p>

<p>Visualize is one of the most common techniques to improve memory is to visualize words and things. You see, the brain sees data as pictures. It will be easily stored and faster to retrieve if it is seen and visualized as one picture than when it is memorized as numbers or words. For instance, if you are trying to memorize a grocery list, you do not memorize the words. You memorize the pictures of the things that you need to buy. That way, when you go to the grocery store, you will remember to buy that item, bettering your memory in the process.</p>

  </header>

    <p>While placing a loved one in a nursing home is a difficult decision, there may come a time when it is the right one. It will help if you do your homework and trust your instincts.</p>

<p>According to the Department of Health and Human Services, the nation’s nursing homes provide care to over 1.5 million people. Over 90% of these residents are over age 65. Most of the residents are frail and require round-the-clock supervision due to dementia.</p>

<p><strong>Things You Need to Know</strong></p>

<p>A nursing home is a residence that provides room, meals, nursing and rehabilitative care, medical services and protective supervision to its residents. While someone coming from the hospital may require the services of many long-term care professionals such as nurses, therapists and social workers, a nursing home is not a hospital (acute care) setting. The goal at a nursing home is to help people maintain as much of their independent functioning as possible in a supportive environment.</p>

<p><strong>Choosing a Facility</strong></p>

<p>One of the first things to consider when making a nursing home choice is the needs of the individual for whom you’re providing care, suggest experts at the MetLife Mature Market Institute®. Make a list of the special care they need, such as dementia care or various types of therapy.</p>

<p>If the person is hospitalized, the discharge planner and/or social workers can assist you in assessing the needs of the individual and locating the appropriate facility.</p>

<p>If you are choosing a nursing facility for someone who is presently at home, ask for referrals from your physician, Area Agency on Aging, friends, and family.</p>

<p>Other factors such as location, cost, the quality of care, services, size, religious and cultural preferences, and accommodations for special care need to be considered.</p>

<p>When you’ve located a few facilities that you’d like to consider more thoroughly, plan on visiting each one, both with scheduled and unscheduled visits, and at different times and on different days of the week.</p>

<p>As you are walking around, take note of what you hear and don’t hear. Is it silent? Is there activity? How clean does it look? Are the residents dressed appropriately for the season? Most importantly, find out the ratio of nurses to residents is and what is the staff turnover rate?</p>

<p><strong>Helpful Hints</strong></p>

<p>When you’ve finally decided on a facility, you should know your rights and those of your family member. Before you or the resident sign the admissions agreement, understand what you’re signing, and do not sign any paperwork unless everything has been fully explained.</p>

<p>The admissions contract should, at a minimum, contain the daily room rate, reasons for discharge and transfer from the nursing home, and the policy regarding payment of the daily room rate if the resident goes to the hospital or the family brings the resident home for a short period of time.</p>

<p>You may question if you’re really making the right decision to place your loved one in a facility at all. Remember, you can do no more than your best, and if you’ve done that, neither you nor your family member can ask any more of you.</p>
