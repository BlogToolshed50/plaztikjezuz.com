  </header>

    <p>Experts believe there is tremendous potential for solar energy. Anything could be possible with the sun?s energy. It provides heat for our swimming pools, rivers, lakes and ponds. It is as a basic as hanging your laundry out on the line and it being dried by the sun. However we have been unable to harness it as a natural source of energy that can be used efficiently.</p>

<p>Scientists believe it is the best alternative source of power. This energy is drawn from heat that strikes the earth. Solar energy has been around for millions of years and it is safe for the environment. It can be renewed and concentrated. Experts are considering it as a viable alternative energy source so it can be used world wide.</p>

<p>It is being used across the world. Inherently, the sun provides a natural heat source which can be used to control temperature without converting it. TO be used for electricity, it needs to be collected and converted. There are different forms of solar energy.</p>

<p>There is widespread use of solar panels to heat houses. Experts have been experimenting and have used solar energy to power cars, unsuccessfully. The technology is not quite there yet. You will not be seeing solar powered cars anytime in the near future. However some experts believe it may be around the corner.</p>

<p>Once captured, solar power, changes and distributes the sun’s power so it can be used for heat and ventilation. A tromp wall is an example of this. It uses solar heat with a system made up of channels of air that are between a window and wall. Then the sun heats the area and circulates through vents and then stores the heat. At night, this stored heat is utilized.</p>

<p>Solar power is dense and is quite an efficient use of power. These facilities could be set up across the world and they are maintenance free. The operating cost is very reasonable after the initial installation. Australia has spent millions of dollars on a solar powered energy station. It is currently generating clean electricity to well over 40,000 locations in the small town of Victoria. It’s very energy efficient and safe for the environment due to there being no gas emissions.</p>

<p>There are other options for solar power such as PV systems. It is connected to an electrical grid and when there is an excess of energy it transfers to another grid. This is extremely efficient and cost effective. The PV cells are set up as a solar panel, and they have become more efficient and the cost of them has gone down tremendously. The designs have improved so that the harnessed sunlight can be focused on a centralized point. The size of the cells decrease as efficiency rises.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Dealing with extended drought conditions can be a daunting affair. Not knowing when a drought will break not only tests farmers, the general community in towns and cities is also affected by subsequent water restrictions and higher food prices.</p>

<p>The hobby farmer is mostly insulated from the financial effects of drought since it is not the main source of income. However, personal pride and a desire to see the farm develop, rather than deteriorate into a dry and unappealing place to spend time, is enough incentive to be proactive in the face of drought conditions.</p>

<p>Special consideration is also required when farm animals are present. The presence of shelter and ample drinking water is paramount if animals are to be comfortable during hot and dry conditions.</p>

<p>Some tactics I have currently employed on my farm are outlined below. As well, general strategies for the future are also mentioned.</p>

<p>When planting young trees and shrubs, ensure the soil is cultivated to reduce competition from weeds growing close to the seedlings. Deep ripping of the planting area also helps any rain to penetrate within the root zone of the seedling. Combined with heavy mulching around the seedling, it will have a greatly increased chance of surviving. Water storing crystals as well as products that enable water to penetrate water repellent soils are also available. Protection from strong hot winds will also reduce evaporation of moisture from around plants. Polymer films that are sprayed onto leaf surfaces can also be used in order to reduce evaporation from plants. These synthetic polymers are currently used when transplanting established plants as a measure to reduce transplanting shock.</p>

<p>Established plants may need to be pruned in order to reduce the level of transpiration from leaf surfaces. Young fruiting trees should have any fruit removed and not be fed with fertilizers which encourage tender growth. Fertilizers containing high levels of nitrogen should be used sparingly; however, a balanced fertilizer at the correct time-usually spring and autumn may be used with care. Sprays extracted from an organic source such as seaweed are useful as they contain a range of micro nutrients that strengthen plant cells. Plants treated in this manner are better suited to survive extreme conditions as the cell walls within plant tissues become thicker and stronger.</p>

<p>Long- term climatic trends are hard to predict, however, consideration needs to be given to issues such as climate change. I have planted native windbreak trees that generally have a lower rainfall requirement than currently received in our region. Should there be a general term trend towards reduced rainfall these plants once established should cope well. In the event of increased rainfall over subsequent seasons after a drought however, there may be problems due to an excess of water given that these types of plantings are normally suited to dry or very well drained soils.</p>

<p>Selecting vegetable crops that have a shorter growing season, often the case with dwarf varieties will save on precious water. Ensuring the soil is well managed and carefully cultivated in order to protect its structure will allow plant root systems to become quickly established. Long term plantings such as fruiting trees and palms need to be carefully reviewed and not planted until conditions improve.</p>

<p>In extreme cases some plants will need to be sacrificed. More common plants and those that can be easily and quickly replaced may need to be removed in order to reduce competition for water. The most efficient methods of irrigation that deliver water close to the root system of the remaining plants also needs to be employed.</p>

<p>Drought proofing my farm in the long term will also require an effective water harvesting system. Expenditure on tanks and soil contouring in order to channel excess moisture to storage areas will need to occur. This process will be constrained by the available finances, but should prove worthwhile in the long term.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Cancer is a very deadly disease. This disease is one of the most deadly in terms of numbers killed year in and out. According to statistics one in three people will be affected by cancer. And one in four people will die of cancer. However cancer could be prevented in certain situations. The first step in cancer prevention is learning what causes it and the risk factors involved. Avoiding these risk factors can help a person reduce the likelihood of having cancers.</p>

<p>Here are the following risk factors that a person can avoid to prevent cancer.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Tobacco – 30% of all cancer deaths in the United States are caused by smoking. It is also responsible for 87% of all people affected by lung cancer. Aside from the lungs, other organs affected by smoking are pancreas, cervix, kidney, stomach and also cause acute myeloid leukemia. Quit smoking to decrease your chances of having cancer. Also try to avoid secondary smoke, secondary smoke can also be deadlier.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have more physical activity – exercise greatly helps reduce your chances of having cancer. Even if it is only for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. Exercising will also make you fit against other disease such as heart ailments. Try the exercise activities such as walking, running, aerobics, or yoga. Exercising can also help prevent obesity, which is also one major cause of cancer. Colon, breast, prostrate, endometrial, and lung cancer can have less chances of developing if you are exercising regularly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Genetics – genetics is one of the causes of cancers. When your family has a history of cancer, the best thing to do is just take precaution. If your family has had a history of cancer, the mutated gene which causes cancer may have been passed down. If your family has had a history, you may get a genetic test. Remember that if your family has had a history of cancer it is not certain that you will have it. Your chances of developing it are just greater.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Environmental Factors – exposure to certain things within your environment can cause you cancer. Such things like asbestos or benzene can be able to cause cancer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unsafe Sex – you are suddenly exposed to not only HIV but also HPV. HPV is also known as Human Pappiliona Virus. Having this virus greatly increase a person’s chance of having anal, vulvar, cervical, or vaginal cancer. There are tests that help a person find out if he or she has the HPV virus. You will need to scrape the cervical cells and send them over to a lab.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sun Exposure – greatly exposing yourself to UV rays will cause skin cancer. Be very wise when tanning or being exposed under the sun.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

  </header>

    <p>So you want to eat healthier, but you\’re hesitating because you\’re too attached to your favorite foods. But who says you had to give them up? There are lots of ways to eat healthier and still enjoy your meals. It\’s all just a matter of changing your habits-sometimes, just a little switch can go a long way. With a bit of planning, you can cut the calories and eat just as well or even better than you used to.</p>

<p>One of the easiest ways to reduce your calorie intake is using more vegetables in your diet. You don\’t have to give up meat altogether (although you can if you want to). Start by replacing one meat dish a week with a vegetarian one. Once you\’re used to it, you can work your way up until you get a good balance of both. That alone can cut at least 100 calories off every meal.</p>

<p>When you do use meat, opt for leaner cuts and trim any fat off before cooking. This is especially useful for beef and lamb recipes, since the cut has a lot to do with how much fat there is in each piece. For chicken, remove the skins beforehand-much of the fat is just under it, and the flavor is in the meat itself anyway. Meats absorb flavor very well, so you can just compensate by adding some seasonings.</p>

<p>If you\’re a big fan of grilled or deep-fried foods, you may want to switch to healthier cooking methods. Steaming and baking give much the same results without the added fat, and sometimes even turn out better since the food retains its natural juices. Sprinkling some water over a roast will give it the crisp texture you get from frying, and adding strong spices can fill out the flavor just as well as grilling.</p>

<p>Another good cooking method is slow cooking, or cooking food in the crock pot. Because it seals in all of the flavor, you don\’t even need to add seasonings-you just chuck the ingredients in and their juices will provide all of the taste. Slow cooking also allows you to choose leaner meats and add more vegetables, since they enhance natural flavors without needing additional fat.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2012/08/08/ten-rules-regarding-food/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Ten Rules Regarding Food</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>(1) Always be mindful of the wholesomeness of food combination:</p>

<p>Even alkali-genic and nutritious foods, when taken without regard to the rules of food combination, can generate toxins in the body.</p>

<p>(2) If you are not hungry, don’t eat:</p>

<p>No other animals, except man, would eat without hunger-the main reason why they are not subject to the ailments which man invites by overburdening the digestion. When really hungry, we relish even the most insipid and unappetizing foods.</p>

<p>(3) Do not eat when you are under physical or mental tension:</p>

<p>If the body or the mind is exhausted or under tension, the secretion of the digestive juices will not be adequate.</p>

<p>(4) Do not eat or drink anything that is too hot or too cold:Ideally the temperature of any food should be around 37 C (98.6 F), the temperature of the body. The enzymes in the mouth and the stomach act best at such temperatures.</p>

<p>(5) Chew your food well:Thorough chewing mixes saliva with the food. Digestion starts off in the mouth itself with the action of the enzymes present in the saliva. Moreover, well-chewed food is easily digested.</p>

<p>(6) Do not drink water with meals: Water requires only ten minutes to be absorbed from the stomach, and in the process it carries the enzymes away. This reduces the efficiency of the digestive process, which may result in the loss of appetite. There is no objection to drinking water fifteen minutes before a meal, half an hour after taking fruits, and two hours after a full meal.</p>

<p>(7) Do not stuff the belly with food: Overeating is always harmful. The stomach is a flexible bag made up of muscles. Its rhythmic contractions and expansions are responsible for the efficient mixing of digestive juices and enzymes with food. These movements are hindered if the bag is stuffed up with excessive food. The enzymes are not mixed properly with the food, which begins to decay. Most people fail to exercise discretion in the amount of food they take. They: seem to live for eating, and not to eat for living! Overeating makes one lethargic and dull. There is a constant feeling of thirst. With time the belly gets enlarged, and one falls victim to disorders of the digestive system. In fact, to keep healthy it is necessary at all times to remain slightly hungry.</p>

<p>(8) Rest for a while after meals: The blood vessels of the stomach dilate just after meals. This stimulates the secretion of enzymes, and thus helps digestion. If work requiring any kind of physical or mental exertion is taken up just after a meal, blood will be diverted from the stomach to other parts of the body like the hand, feet or brain, slowing down digestion.</p>

<p>(9) Do not take any food while suffering from fever or any other ailment: This is essential. It is a fact that we never do feel hungry when we are indisposed, and actually feel averse to taking any food. During an illness, the secretion of digestive juices is greatly reduced. As a result, the digestive processes are almost at a standstill.</p>

<p>(10) Eat only one meal, or take only fruits, one day every week:</p>

<p>Giving occasional rest to the stomach is as necessary as giving it its usual assignment of digestion, for maintaining its efficiency. Moreover, when the body is not occupied in the task of digestion, it is free to tackle the poisons that have been accumulated in it.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Having good interpersonal communication skill is a combination of being able to say what you mean clearly and concisely, and being able to take on board other people’s opinions and adapt what you say accordingly, as well as making them feel they can speak freely.</p>

<p>To do that, you’ve got to be aware of your own role in the conversation and be able to manage your own attitudes and emotions so that the conversation fulfills the agenda of everyone involved and does not get heated or over-emotional if difficult topics need to be discussed.</p>

<p>It’s not as difficult as it sounds, with just a few hints</p>

<p>and tips:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Body Language</li>
</ol>

<p>Being able to read body language and being aware of the signals you are giving to other people is probably one of the most important parts of interpersonal communication skill – and yet it is often overlooked. More than half your message is got across without even opening your mouth!</p>

<p>Most people will never have thought about that, but their brains will instinctively process this non-verbal communication.</p>

<p>Your body language will really let your emotions show through, so control your anger, nerves etc so that you can speak and listen more effectively, rather than being over-occupied with how you are feeling.</p>

<p>Don’t worry, though – a lot of body language is common-sense. Holding eye contact for a comfortable amount of time, leaning forward and nodding occasionally are sure signs that the other person is listening to you, so be sure you give off these signals too – and don’t fake them!</p>

<ol>
  <li>Listen</li>
</ol>

<p>You can’t expect to learn anything from a conversation if you don’t listen to it properly. Take the time to respect what other people are saying, no matter how ridiculous they</p>

<p>sound! There may just be a grain of sense in there – and even if there isn’t, it’s everyone’s right to hold a silly point of view!</p>

<ol>
  <li>Be aware of who you’re speaking to</li>
</ol>

<p>Everyone is different and you will need to tailor your communication for the different types of people you are speaking to. Make sure you use language that can be understood but which isn’t patronizing.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Diffuse situations when you can</li>
</ol>

<p>Always try to relive the tension if someone you are talking to is feeling tense and upset or angry. Don’t bite back if they make a negative or insulting comment. That will just escalate the problem.</p>

<p>So how do you diffuse a situation? First – don’t under-estimate the power of a few seconds silence. It allows people to calm down, reflect – and think of how they can move the conversation on more usefully. YOU may need to be the one that suggests you all take a break for a little while, to allow tensions to ease.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Help people out</li>
</ol>

<p>If you can see someone is feeling awkward and seems not to know what to say, see if you can help them out – tactfully. Perhaps you may ask them a direct question that gets them</p>

<p>started. Or if they’re struggling for a specific word, perhaps you can supply some suggestions – or try another question to elucidate their meaning. This should hopefully</p>

<p>let them know that they don’t need to use fancy words to get their meaning across and allow them to relax.</p>

<p>Try these and you’ll soon feel more relaxed in conversations and be able to manage them much more effectively so you all achieve what you want to in the conversation. It is amazing</p>

<p>how much some simple tips can help build your interpersonal communication skill.</p>
