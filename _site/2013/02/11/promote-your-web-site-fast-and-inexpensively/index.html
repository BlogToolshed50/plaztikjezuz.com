    <p>Don’t expect that your site will grow automatically. The old saying of build it and they will come does not ring true online. Here are some tips on promoting your web site fast and inexpensively.</p>

<p>There are a variety of ways to promote your web site. Blogs, direct links, advertising and search engine submission. Blogs are great ways to provide viewers to come visit your site. Many people create blogs just to promote their web site. Blogs can also be pinged so that spiders will visit your site and hopefully rank your web pages in their search engine index.</p>

<p>Links are also a great way to promote your web site. You can swap links with other sites that viewers might find interesting. You can also create one way links on articles and submit these articles to be used on other web sites. These articles are great advertisements for people to see and check out your site.</p>

<p>Advertising is always a great way to promote your site. You can promote your keywords at Google Ad-words or on a site that already has good traffic. No matter what kind of budget you have, you can find advertising that can work for you. Lastly, you can submit your sites to the search engines. If the search engines rank your site high in their indexes, you are almost guaranteed daily visitors. So follow the above tips to promote your web site fast and inexpensively.</p>
