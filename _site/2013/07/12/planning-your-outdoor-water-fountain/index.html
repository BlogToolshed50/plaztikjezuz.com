    <p>Just because it’s the thick of winter doesn’t mean you can’t plan your outdoor landscape now. That includes picking and designing your plans in conjunction with a new garden water fountain. An outdoor fountain can add different levels, light and motion, but to get the best results it’s always a good idea to plan ahead. Water Fountain Place’s fountain experts often get questions about which fountains would be best for a particular garden or other location. The answer ultimately depends on your personal preferences, but there are some basic practical guidelines to observe.</p>

<p>Electricity for Your Outdoor Fountain</p>

<p>Your first consideration is electricity. Modern outdoor fountains almost always work from a three-prong power supply. You must be able to run a waterproof electrical line to your fountain that nobody’s going to trip over, and that won’t ruin the look of your garden, deck and other space. If you’re considering a major landscaping change, you might want to add an all-weather outlet close to where you’d like to place your outdoor fountain. If you’d like to put your outdoor fountain somewhere that you can’t easily run a cord to, consider purchasing a solar garden fountain. You can place solar powered fountains anywhere the solar panel can catch direct sunlight.</p>

<p>Find a Level Space for Your Garden Fountain</p>

<p>Modern water fountains don’t usually need complicated plumbing only require a small amount of maintenance, but they’re not 100% painless (just 99%!). You need to find or build a level space large enough to contain the entire fountain and clearance on each side. One reason it’s good to think about this sort of thing in the off-season is that you may have to do some minor landscaping to get the ideal spot. When you pick a level location, consider the fact that you need to be able to reach the garden fountain’s cord, get through its basin and pump and once the season ends, winterize your fountain. Depending on the fountain this might require anything from an inch or two of clearance to a level walkway around most of its circumference.</p>

<p>Consider the Surrounding Colors</p>

<p>When it comes to picking your fountain, think of the surrounding colors. You can take two approaches here. First, you can pick a fountain based on your existing plants, flowers, lawns and stone work. Second, you can pick the fountain’s color freely, but plan to rearrange the space to suit it. This doesn’t mean you have to do major digging. In many cases, just planting new flowers, adding new or different stones or seeding a former gravel path area with new grass ca fine tune your outdoor space to match your preferred fountain perfectly. When in doubt, consider metallic and mirrored fountains, which go with most color schemes, or earth tones, which will also almost always match.</p>

<p>Make Your Outdoor Fountain Animal and Child Safe</p>

<p>Beyond look, convenience and maintenance considerations, remember to make your new garden fountain safe to be around. This article lists them last because they don’t affect the choice or placement of your fountain, but they actually come first on your list of priorities. Even if you don’t own children and pets, Water Fountain Place strongly recommends keeping your fountain water and basin clean using a non-toxic product. You never know who might stray into your garden, and in many areas owner liability is clearly established in the law. Fortunately, it’s easy to keep your fountain’s water clean; Water Fountain Place sells an enzyme based fountain protector that’s non-toxic to keep pets, kids and wildlife safe from accidental exposure</p>
