    <p>Every now and then we come across news that life is in existence outside the earth.Many in fact bring out the information that they have sighted objects which are believed to be from elsewhere from different planets and much more.All these vouch for the possibility of the presence of aliens out side the earth.However the astronomers are of the view that even if such lives exist,such entities may not be intelligent or multi-cellular.The institute of astronomy in Cambridge has come out with the observation that over the past few decades the scientists have slowly become more open to the idea that life exists elsewhere in the universe too.</p>

<p>According to scientists, the technology has in fact enabled the astronomers to find more about the universe and the invention of radio telescope has helped them to explore more.The invention of the molecules which is the basic precursors of life, was made possible through the radio telescopes.Contrary to the belief in the past that planets around the stars are a rare phenomena,the present day astronomers are of the view that,planets are common and they are present around the binary stars.We can only hope that such lives in the universe will compliment to our efforts for the progress of the lives duly keeping in mind the healthy survival of the universe as a whole.</p>
