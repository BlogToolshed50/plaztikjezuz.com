    <p>What is it you want out of life? Once you decide what it is you want to do and where you want to be, you then must realize what you have to do to change your thinking to achieve these desires. When we were babies, we knew exactly what we wanted. We cried loudly with no inhibitions holding back until we got what we wanted. As we got older, we were clear about what we wanted and headed straight toward it with no fear. Along the way, we would hear someone say, don’t do this or that and as we got older the negative words would be more intense. As we go through our lives, we somehow get stuck trying to figure out what other people want us to do. As a result we now do a lot of things we don’t want to do but what pleases others.</p>

<p>So how do we reclaim ourselves and our true desires? How do we get back what we really want with no fear, shame or inhibitions? How do we reconnect with our real passion. We start on the smallest level by honoring our preferences in every situation, no matter how large or small. Don’t think of them as petty, they might be inconsequential to someone else, but they are not to you. To renown your power and get what you really want out of life, you will have to stop saying,” I don’t know, I don’t care, It doesn’t matter to me. When you are confronted with a choice, act as if you have a preference. Ask yourself, “if I did know,what would it be? If I did care, which would I prefer? If it did matter, what would I rather do.</p>

<p>Not being clear about what you want and making other peoples needs and desires more important than your own is simply a habit. You can break it by practicing the opposite habit. To be successful in life, you have to decide where you want to go by clarifying your vision through goal settings affirmations and visualization and start moving in the right direction. One of the easiest ways to do this is to make a list of possessions you want to acquire. Close your eyes and visualize how it feels to already have them. What it would be like to have financial independence and live the life you have always dreamed of. There are people who will try to talk you out of your dreams. They will try to bring you down to their level. These people are called dream-stealer. Don’t listen to them. Believe in yourself, whether you call it self-esteem or self confidence it is a deep seated belief that you have what it takes.</p>

<p>My journey started the day I stepped onto the path of being an entrepreneur. I made a strong commitment to do whatever it took to forge ahead. Believing in myself and knowing that the mistakes I made along the way only made me stronger. There are three things that will help you be successful and they are activity, commitment, and self-esteem. Follow your intentions and everything will start to fall into place.</p>
