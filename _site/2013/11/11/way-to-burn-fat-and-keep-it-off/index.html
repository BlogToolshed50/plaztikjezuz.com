    <p>What is the best way to burn fat off your body, and look and feel absolutely terrific? It sounds almost like a dream for many people. However, while everyone’s bodies and goals may be different, there are some basic fat loss principles that will help you burn fat fast.</p>

<p>The first thing you want to do is take a look at your current diet and make a decision to start making long-term improvements. This may involve replacing bad habits such as snacking on chocolate bars with new positive habits such as resorting to fruits and nuts for snacks.</p>

<p>When being asked for diet advice, I always recommend cutting way back on sugary drinks, fried foods and other foods high in sugar and unhealthy fats. I also recommend sticking to natural and unprocessed sources of foods as much as possible. Really, is it any surprise that 35% of Americans are obese when the average American diet is pizza, fried foods, pastries, donuts, ice cream, soft drinks, sodas, beers, and whatever else we’re polluting our bodies with?</p>

<p>When you begin a program to lose fat, it is easy to fall into the habit of cutting calories. Most dieters do exactly that, drastically lowering their calories to the point where they aren’t losing fat, they’re unknowingly burning up muscle tissue. As a result, their body starts to use fewer calories to maintain itself and they find themselves gaining fat much easier when they finish their diet.</p>

<p>So if reducing your calories is not the best way to burn fat, what is? Well, instead of focusing on depriving yourself, and increasing the chances of burning muscle tissue, focus on eating small, frequent and healthy meals and perform regular fat-burning aerobic exercise. Fortunately, you don’t have to spend your life in the gym as there are many ways of exercising. Who knows, you might choose to get an exercise video to work out with if that suits your lifestyle, or you may decide to pick up a sport you could enjoy.</p>

<p>Performing the right type of aerobic exercise not only burns fat through the workout itself, but it also increases the calories you burn after the workout, increases production of specific enzymes and hormones which promote fat burning, and increase your insulin sensitivity, resulting in less carbohydrates being stored as fat. Apart from being the best way to burn fat it is a great way to increase your general health and fitness.</p>

<p>If I told you that by adding another part to the fat loss equation you could not only multiply your results, but at the same time get stronger, improve your exercise performance, prevent injuries and much more, while achieving a more toned appearance and a huge confidence boost, would you be interested?</p>

<p>Simply eating smaller healthier meals and performing regular aerobic exercise will begin the fat loss process, but the best way to burn fat also includes strength training. It will stop your body eating away your muscle tissue, and also build muscle at the same time which means that, since muscle tissue needs energy to be maintained, your metabolism will increase significantly as your body will need more calories as your muscles develop.</p>

<p>To get the biggest benefits from strength training consider lifting weights regularly, although body weight workouts are also very beneficial. Not only does your metabolism become faster allowing you to burn more calories even while resting, you’ll also find that your aerobic workouts will burn more calories as a result of the increased muscle.</p>

<p>Avoid the hype out there telling you that simply lowering calories will magically strip the fat off your body. Eating frequent, small and healthy meals, performing regular fat-burning aerobic exercise and strengthening and building muscle is the best way to burn fat fast and keep it off for good</p>
