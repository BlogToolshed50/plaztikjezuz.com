    <p>By logging on to the net, you are at risk at once. Online security threats are a big challenge today. There are several types of threats on the internet.The main threats are Spy-ware, Viruses and Hackers.</p>

<p>It is absolutely necessary to protect yourself, your computer and your personal information from these threats. Use all the security software needed.There are three security software applications you should have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Firewall Protection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anti-virus Software</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anti Spy-ware Software</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should also be aware of your passwords, and protection of these.</p>

<p>A good thing to remember is to never use the same password for all your accounts, and never share it with anyone. Do not store your passwords on your computer either. Use passwords that contains both</p>

<p>letters and numbers and preferably special characters.</p>

<p>You have most likely been attacked by spy-ware programs once or more. It is the most common online threat. Spy-ware is software designed to steal information from your computer. It installs without your knowledge, and sends information such as passwords, credit card information, documents, bank account details, and much more.</p>

<p>Types of spy-ware could be: Trojan horses, key loggers, dialer, and ad-ware programs. Anti-spy-ware software could protect you from these threats, and there are several brands to choose from. Many are great applications, but some of them are just dealing with a specific problem. Avoid these.Anti virus software is necessary to protect yourself from viruses. Many viruses are sent via email as an attachment, and others are sent through file-sharing applications. Others are sent via instant messaging programs such as Windows MSN. With a good anti-virus solution that auto updates itself, you should be well protected. It is a good idea to scan all files that you download, and check all incoming mails too. Many anti virus programs are installed with a email scanner.Firewall is necessary to prevent your computer from being intruded by hackers. This software controls every application on your computer that has a network connection, and blocks access from those you don’t allow to connect. A good tip for Windows XP users is to make sure that the included firewall is turned on. You might think that you have to spend loads of money to be protected online. This doesn’t have to be right. There are many great free applications on the net, but the paid ones are usually better.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that you should have some kind of protection, because without you are totally naked to these threats.</p>
