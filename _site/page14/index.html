  </header>

    <p>Communicating with children of any age is probably the key parenting skill, as it helps build their self-esteem and confidence.</p>

<p>Through parenting we can prepare our children to survive and thrive in their environment. The environment that today’s society provides children is full of challenges and big issues like drugs, violence, and sex. That is why it is so important for children and parents to communicate openly.</p>

<p>Communication takes both talking and listening. Listening, instead of lecturing, gives children space to share their feelings, and by sorting through their own problems can help with their decision making skills. Further, good communication helps children develop confidence, feelings of self-worth, and good relationships with others.</p>

<p>At every age children need their parents to understand how they’re feeling. It’s your job to make your child feel that she can talk to you about anything going on in her life. You achieve this by listening properly and not leaping in with your own judgments or constantly blaming your child.</p>

<p>You want to be wise and prepared when you talk to your teen. Here are tips that can help. Good communication helps children and parents to develop confidence, feelings of self-worth, and good relationships with others. Try these tips:</p>

<p>• Teach children to listen… gently touch a child before you talk… say their name.</p>

<p>• Eat at least one meal together per day. Mealtime allows for two-way conversation and family bonding</p>

<p>• Use time in the car wisely. Turn mom’s taxi service into an opportunity for stimulating conversation!</p>

<p>• Speak in a quiet voice… whisper sometimes so children have to listen… they like this.</p>

<p>• Host a family night each week. With a little effort, most families can set aside one evening per week for family activity.</p>

<p>• Practice listening and talking: talk with your family about what you see on TV, hear on the radio or see at the park or store. (Talk with your children about school and their friends.)</p>

<p>• Organize a 10-minute family time before bed each evening to cuddle on the sofa and affirm your love for your children.</p>

<p>• Look a child in the eyes so you can tell when they understand… bend or sit down… become the child’s size.</p>

<p>• Host family meetings to give your children a forum in which their input matters.</p>

<p>• Express positive emotions. It takes more than just words to communicate positively. Studies show that only 7 percent of our message is through our words while 38 percent is through our tone of voice and 55 percent is through our posture and facial expressions!</p>

<p>• Be conscious of how your communication affects your children. Children take cues from you as how to treat others in the family, as well as how to act outside the home.</p>

<p>Many parents only see their children when they’re at home. Get involved with your child’s school. Volunteer to help with extracurricular programs, such as theater or sports. You may discover new and wonderful aspects to your child that you otherwise would have missed.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2012/12/24/plan-that-fantastic-cruise-vacation/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Plan That Fantastic Cruise Vacation</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>So you’re thinking of having a cruise vacation. Almost anybody could have a cruise vacation, but it takes a lot of planning to get that fantastic cruise vacation.</p>

<p>Planning starts months before your actual vacation date. So how do you start planning for you first cruise? You might have to ask yourselves first what made you decide to take a cruise vacation instead.</p>

<p>Is it because you have read about great cruise vacations over the web or some magazines, envied some friends or relatives who recently went on one or missed the all the fun you had when you last had went on a cruise vacation?</p>

<p>For first time cruisers, you may want to ask advise from friends and family. You’ll find out they’ll be more than glad to help you plan ahead. That’s because planning could also be so much fun.</p>

<p>Lots of people would be too eager to provide you with ideas on what to do, where to go and how to get some discounted rates. First time cruisers usually approach travel agencies to have their cruise vacations arranged.</p>

<p>However, before you start browsing the internet for the best travel agency, you may want to consult the rest of your companions first for the basic details of the trip. First consider whom you are going with.</p>

<p>Are you going out with your whole family?</p>

<p>Will you be going out with a partner or with a group of highly adventurous friends?</p>

<p>The type of companions you’ll be going would determine a lot about the rest of your cruise details. Most cruise ships welcome all age groups, from toddlers to great grandparents. There are also ships that cater to adults only.</p>

<p>Next thing to be considered would be your budget. Are you willing to mortgage your house and car to get enough finances for the trip? In getting a cruise vacation, there are no maximum to the budget.</p>

<p>You may only be able to cut down costs by shopping around first before finally deciding. You could also save a lot by having more than just two persons per cabin or booking six months in advance. A “mainstream” cruise line could average $500 a week on a minimum.</p>

<p>Do you want to get that cabin with a balcony? That would be more expensive than getting just a cabin with a small window or port hole. However, if you’re going on a honeymoon, you might consider that room which features a veranda.</p>

<p>The budget largely depends on how long are you planning to go on a cruise trip. Also, the length of your trip gives you the possibilities on where you might be able to go to. A week-long cruise trip would get you to the Carribean or to Europe.</p>

<p>More than seven days, you’d be able to plan a cruise vacation to any of the seven continents.</p>

<p>However, if you’re on a strict schedule, and possible answers to a tight budget, a long weekend off to the Bahamas and Mexico would be great. There are also “cruise-to-nowhere” trips. Your ship would just sail out into the ocean.</p>

<p>You won’t get anywhere though, but at least, you’d be able to get the hang of how it is to go into a cruise trip.</p>

<p>Next question to be dealt with is the time and place of the vacation. When and where would you like to go on a cruise. Cruise trips are relatively cheaper during the fall or spring, when most kids are in school.</p>

<p>Some places like Alaska or North of Europe are only available in specific months, but most ships cruise all the year round in most places like the Caribbean, Mediterranean or Hawaii.</p>

<p>The earth is covered with more water, so there should be a lot of available cruise destinations for you to choose from. Just keep in mind that different locations have its own special climate and you would have to research prior to going on a vacation to be prepared for any difference from what you have at home.</p>

<p>Then you would have to decide on the things you would like to do while on cruise. There are numerous of activities available on-board. Also, cruise ships, like in European cruises, dock in ports that would allow you to tour the city.</p>

<p>Pacific and Caribbean cruises on the other hand would give you the opportunity to explore the different islands. And of course, there are a lot of shore activities that you’d be able to do, like scuba diving.</p>

<p>You might want to get a general idea of what you’d like to do. Some cruise ships may have only limited or specific available excursions.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things to be accounted for when going on a cruise vacation. But you’ll surely enjoy making all of these preparations, and a fantastic cruise vacation you’ll enjoy more.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Think this is a bad joke? Think again! In this day in age it’s not uncommon to see teenagers with piercing all over their body. Essentially most parts of the body can be pierced in one form or another and this dramatically increases the chances of hepatitis, HIV, tetanus, auricular hematologic, cauliflower ear, infections, allergic reactions, bleeding, and damage to nerves or teeth.</p>

<p>Most parents don’t understand why their teenagers want to get pierced, but for most teens it’s about individuality, fashion and personal freedom. Despite the health warnings, body and ear piercing among teenagers is on the rise! Because of this it’s important to let parents and teens know of the potential dangers of un-safe piercing.</p>

<p>For many parents the idea of letting their teenagers get pierced is a scary thing. Parents should consider that piercing is not something that was invented overnight. Many cultures dating back thousands of years have used piercing and tattoos as a symbol of importance, religious beliefs and yes even as decoration. This being said piercing knowledge has come a very long way as well as the proper medical equipment. Parents should do as much research as possible into the available medical equipment before making a decision on teenage piercing. A great way is to do online research or even better yet, talk to other parents who have teenagers with piercing. Chances are they have gone through all the anxiety you may experience and know the answers to many of the questions that are running wild in your mind.</p>

<p>Along with the explosion of ear and body piercing has come research into the many new possibilities of damaging ones ears or jeopardizing ones health. Also new medical equipment has been developed to fight those problems. Scientists at the Center for Disease Control are researching a possible link between piercing and the infectious liver disease of viral hepatitis. Parents and teens should keep in mind that getting pierced with non-sterilized medical equipment can dramatically increase your chances of contracting hepatitis which is much more contagious than HIV (the virus that causes AIDS)! This alone should be enough to scare parents and teenagers and motivate them to become more informed on the subject of piercing and more informed about the proper medical equipment. However there are safe ways to get piercing.</p>

<p>Many doctors and online resources don’t recommend doing the piercing yourself. Lack of medical sterilization equipment, proper piercing tools and experience typically lead to infections and / or hepatitis. If you’re going to let your teenager get pierced choose wisely. Take them to a reputable piercing shop that uses state-of-the-art medical equipment and do your homework! Most piercing shops will be glad to explain proper sterilization practices with the right medical equipment and ask about the use of medical equipment such sterilizers and autoclaves which are used to effectively sanitize the tools needed for piercing. If you notice that the piercing shop uses a piercing gun to do body piercing go elsewhere. Piercing guns can’t be sterilized and drastically increase the chance of infections.</p>

<p>If you want to play it really safe you can purchase a disposable ear piercing kit online. Many online medical equipment stores offer these kits at a very reasonable price. But keep in mind these kits are only for ear piercing, not body piercing. You should also consider letting someone with piercing experience pierce your teenager even with a disposable kit. These kits are very easy to use and are fully disposable thereby drastically reducing the risk of contracting hepatitis and other infections. Keep in mind however, that after your ear piercing is safely done you are not out of danger. Proper maintenance is required after you get your piercing. It’s recommended that you wash the area with soap daily and use isopropyl alcohol on both sides of the ear at least twice a day. Another good idea is to use an antibiotic ointment every night for the first week. A triple antibiotic is preferred. Most drug stores or supermarkets will carry brand name and generic versions of these ointments.</p>

<p>If you decide to let your teenagers get their ear pierced they should start by wearing only gold earrings first. Some teenagers will find they are allergic to other metals. Once you have your earrings you should rotate them a minimum of twice a day to help prevent scabbing. It’s recommended that you don’t remove your earrings for at least three to four weeks to provide the skin adequate time to heal. Teenagers should wear their earrings a majority of the time during the first year. As far as body piercing goes most piercing shops will provide a list of needed “care and maintenance procedures” to keep your body piercing from becoming infected.</p>

<p>Allowing a teenager to receive ear and body piercing can be very scary for parents. With all the potential health risks it’s easy to see why some parents don’t allow their teenagers to get piercing. However it’s good to keep in mind that if done appropriately your teenagers will remain in good health and will be allowed to express themselves in a unique way that they so desire.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2012/12/10/investment-strategy-the-investors-creed/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Investment Strategy: The Investor&#8217;s Creed</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Fascinating, isn’t it, this stock market of ours, with its unpredictability, promise, and unscripted daily drama! But individual investors are even more interesting. We’ve become the product of a media driven culture that must have reasons, predictability, blame, scapegoats, and even that four-letter word, certainty. We are a culture of investors where hindsight is rapidly replacing the reality-based foresight that once was flowing in our now real-time veins… just like downhill racing, grouse hunting, and Super bowls.</p>

<p>The Stock Market is a dynamic place where investors can consistently make reasonable returns on their capital if they comply with the basic principles of the endeavor AND if they don’t measure their progress too frequently with irrelevant measuring devices. The classic investment strategy is so simple and so trite that most investors dismiss it routinely and move on in their search for the holy investment grail(s): a stock market that only rises and a bond market capable of paying higher interest rates at stable or higher prices! Just not going to happen…</p>

<p>This is mythology, not investing. Investors who grasp the realities of these wonderful marketplaces recognize the opportunities and embrace them with an understanding that goes beyond the media hype and side show performance enhancement barkers. Simply put, when investment grade securities rise in price [As they are now, finally putting together a successful attack on the 11,000 barrier], Take Your Profits, because that’s the purpose of investing in the stock market! On the flip side (and there has always been a flip side, more commonly dreaded as a “correction”), replenish your portfolio inventory with investment grade securities. Yes, even some that you may have just sold days or weeks ago during the rally. This is much more than an oversimplification; it is a long-term (a year or two is not long term.) strategy that succeeds… cycle, after cycle, after cycle. Sounds an awful lot like Buy Low/Sell High doesn’t it? Obviously, Wall Street can’t let you know that it is quite so simple!</p>

<p>(1) There have been significantly more stocks rising in price on a daily basis than moving lower. In fact, more than two-thirds of the last 68 months have been positive. (2) Since April 2000, there have been 120 more positive days in NYSE issue breadth than negative days. (3) 250% more NYSE stocks established new high price levels than new lows. (4) We are working on our sixth consecutive year of positive issue breadth!]</p>

<p>So understand that your portfolio statement values will rise and fall throughout time, and rather than rejoice or cry, you should be taking actions that will enhance your “Working Capital” and the ability of your portfolio to accomplish your long term goals and objectives. Through the simple application of a few easy to memorize rules, you can plot a course to an investment portfolio that regularly achieves higher highs and (much more importantly), higher lows! Left to its own devices, an mismanaged portfolio is likely to have long periods of unproductive sideways motion. You can ill afford to travel six years at a break even pace, and it is foolish, even irresponsible, to expect any mismanaged or passively directed approach to be in sync with your personal financial needs.</p>

<p>Five simple concepts of Asset Allocation, Investment Strategy, and Psychology are summed up quite nicely in what I call “The Investor’s Creed”:</p>

<p>(1) My intention is to be fully invested in accordance with my planned equity/fixed income asset allocation. (2) On the other hand, every security I own is for sale, and every security I own generates some form of cash flow that cannot be reinvested immediately. (3) I am happy when my cash position is nearly 0% because all of my money is then working as hard as it possibly can to meet my objectives. (4) But, I am ecstatic when my cash position approaches 100% because that means I’ve sold everything at a profit, and that I am in a position to (5) take advantage of any new investment opportunities (that fit my guidelines) as soon as I become aware of them.</p>

<p>If you are managing your portfolio properly, your cash position has been rising lately, as you take profits on the securities you purchased when prices were falling just a few months ago… and (this is a big and) you could well be chock full of cash well before the market blows the whistle on its advance! Yes, if you are going about the investment process properly, you will be swimming in cash at about the same time Wall Street discovers the rally and starts encouraging people to weight their portfolios more heavily into stocks; the number of IPOs coming to market starts to rise exponentially; morning drive radio DJ’s start to laugh about their stock market successes; and all of your friends start to talk about their new investment guru or the 30% gains in their growth Mutual Funds. What are you doing in cash!</p>

<p>This is what I call “smart” cash, because it represents realized profits, interest, and dividends that are just catching a breather on the bench after a scoring drive. As the gains compound at money market rates, the disciplined coach looks for sure signs of investor greed in the market place: fixed income prices fall as speculators abandon their long term goals and reach for the new investment stars that are sure to propel equity prices ever higher, boring investment grade equities fall in price as well because it now clear that the market will never fall again… particularly NASDAQ, which could double and still not be where it was six years ago. And the beat goes on, cycle after cycle, generation after generation. What do you think; will today’s coaches be any smarter than those of the late nineties? Have they learned that it is the very strength of a rising market that proves to be its greatest weakness!</p>

  </header>

    <p>We all want happiness. We all desire appreciation. We all crave for recognition. We all want to be applauded. We all need to be called as good and lovely human beings. We are all looking for this certificate from our friends, family and our partner. This makes us happy. This makes us feel good about ourselves. This gives us new confidence in ourselves. This all gives us a new and positive self esteem, which is very important. How to get it?</p>

<p>Let us do all this for others. If no one is praising us, let us praise others. Let us do all that we want others to do to us. Let us give love, affection, appreciation, and let us applaud others even for a very small victory. Will this help us? It helps us immediately. The first feeling we get after doing a good deed is that of satisfaction. This raises our self esteem. This makes us feel good. By making others happy, we get happiness. So let us become proactive and get all we want by not asking for it, but giving it.</p>

<p>What about those who get such praise from us? They will feel very happy. They will be happy with us. They will like us even more. They will like to do something in return. They will do all that we have been wishing for. Send happiness to get happiness. The shortest route to a lovely life.</p>

<p>Here are some immediate resources for you. Send e-cards across to whoever you can think of. Within few days, your own inbox will be full of messages of praise, love and applause. The e-cards for Congratulate, Good Day, Thinking of you, and Thank You. Happiness is a state of mind. We feel happy when we feel contented with ourselves..In a happy state,one feels cheerful with one’s life and circumstances.</p>

<p>Remaining unhappy is not our goal in life, but happiness is our goal. If we are not happy, life become a burden. In an unhappy state, one lives, but only because one has no other choice. Why not make happiness a part of everyday living? Giving pain to a friend or anyone for that matter is a crime against humanity, provided that pain is undeserved. Even if the pain or punishment is deserved by anyone, we can always try and forgive. Better to focus on giving happiness to others. By giving happiness, we get it in return manifold.</p>

  </header>

    <p>obs in Middle East have always been the most sought after career destination by job seekers. Apart from the monetary reasons, what attracts expatriates to cities in Middle East is the warm and welcoming nature of its expatriates. Low crime rate, peaceful environment, law and order in place, luxurious lifestyle-what more can one ask for? The need of companies to employ foreign workforce in their country has led to a high rise in their ever growing population. In fact, today their population has grown so much that it is almost outnumbering the local population in various regions. The trend continues as all the companies-local and international show their readiness in hiring foreigners even for top level positions.</p>

<p>Middle East jobs are plenty in numbers and happily awaiting a talented and skilled pool of expatriates. You only have to remain alert and grab an opportunity as soon as it knocks your door. But, to make that happen, you need to put in some efforts too. Some useful tips for a quick job search in Middle East are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Conduct a research on the employment scenario in your field of expertise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Look for firms and companies operating in your area of interest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After identifying them, take up a detailed research on its management, products and services produced and sold and other things.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Know more about the key managers and the future vision of the firms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Locate the structure, staff, location of head office, branches or other nearest outlets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prepare an organized resume that clearly defines your qualifications, experiences, training and other important attributes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draft it in a way that it meets the eligibility and requirements of the positions available in the organization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apply only for positions that you deem yourself capable of and can fill them easily.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dont hope against hope and send out your job application only for a vacancy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Send your resume only to the key persons of a department and not to the HR. In case that particular firm has an HR recruitment firm, you can try approaching them who can then forward your resume.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is very important to convince the employers of your skills and expertise. The best part of employers in Middle East is that once they have the conviction about your abilities, they are ready to pay even a little higher to hire you. And, this stage should be handled with a lot of care and intelligence as it gives you an opportunity to progress your application in a better way.</p>

<p>It is quite natural that you may face competition while searching for jobs in Middle East. There are many expatriates interested in pursuing their career goals in Gulf regions or Middle East. They possess similar qualifications and stand a close chance of getting selected posing threat to your employment. Strong networking comes really handy in such situations as jobs known to you through contacts are not advertised on a larger scale ruining the scope of competition. Also, it becomes easier to introduce the employer to your skill sets and abilities that helps in winning his/ her confidence in the test or interview.</p>

<p>At this point, when the company believes that you are good enough to meet the job requirements, you can put forth your salary expectations on a more personal level. You are not competing for the position anymore and have also demonstrated your skills, thus, standing a better chance of success. Do not ask for overestimated amounts and keep yourself humble by avoiding self appraise.</p>

<p>Just little awareness and efforts to pursue your goals will reward you with a perfect job in Middle East.</p>
