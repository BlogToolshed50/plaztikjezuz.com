  </header>

    <p>Are your kids safe when riding on wheels – bicycles, scooters, skateboards or in-line skates? Safe Kids Canada, a national child safety program, has launched the “Got Wheels – Get a Helmet!” campaign this spring. Safe Kids Canada urges Canadians to follow these three tips to keep their children safe:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure your child wears a helmet that fits correctly, as well as other protective gear.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Bike: bike helmet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scooter: a bike helmet, elbow pads and knee pads.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In-line skates: a bike helmet, wrist pads, elbow pads and knee pads.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Skateboard: a skateboard helmet, wrist pads, elbow pads and knee pads.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure your child rides or skates in a safe environment – away from cars and other vehicles.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Scooters, in-line skates, and skateboards do not belong on the road.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bicycles are classed as vehicles, but research shows that children under 10 should not ride their bicycles on the road. They do not have the physical skills or the judgment to stay safe in traffic. Children over 10 need good training and lots of practice before they can ride on the road. Kids need to practice these skills with adult supervision in safe places.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Supervise children until at least eight years of age. Know your child’s abilities.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Most injuries on wheels happen because children lose control and fall. Children need to practice controlling their equipment, and they need your guidance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your child needs to learn basic skills, such as controlling speed and turns, braking, balancing and avoiding obstacles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reinforce safety rules while you supervise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometime between the ages of 8 and 10, your child will develop the coordination and judgment required to ride or skate safely without your supervision – but not near traffic.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2014/08/11/ideas-for-organizing-kids-artwork/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Ideas for Organizing Kids Artwork</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>In school, kids are encouraged to create, draw, color, paint and build. These activities can certainly stimulate children, and help them grow.</p>

<p>Very often, these masterpieces that your children create are brought home and proudly displayed. But what do you do when all of the artwork begins to take over your home? Here are 7 great ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>FIND THE DIAMONDS. Rather than keeping every single piece of artwork your child creates, sit down with your child on a regular basis and ask him to choose the one or two he likes best. By the end of the year, you should have no more than 5 pieces of artwork that your child believes to be his “best” pieces. This will help keep the artwork under control, and will still give you an opportunity to save his creations for future memories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS. Take photos of the artwork that your child creates and keep these photos in a scrapbook. This way, even if the artwork is discarded for space purposes, you’ll still have the memory!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>KIDS FILE STORAGE BOX. Office supply stores carry portable file boxes that hold hanging file folders. These generally have a cover and a handle for easy portability. Help your child create her very own filing system. Perhaps one file folder for 2nd grade artwork, one for 3rd grade artwork, and so on. Now, all the drawings, and any type of artwork that lays flat, will be kept safe and organized. You’ll even be teaching your child filing skills! It’s never too early!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>KEEP IT CONTAINED. For other artwork that does not lay flat, the perfect container may be a large, plastic container with a lid. Your child will have a space for shadowboxes, and other artwork that won’t fit into a file folder. Again, be choosy. If you keep every single piece of artwork your child brings home for the next 15 years, your house is going to be overflowing with it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>HANG IT. Get your child his very own artwork bulletin board so he can display his favorite artwork in his bedroom. When organized on a nice cork board, this really adds a nice touch to a child’s room. Plus, your child can very easily switch one piece of art, with another.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>SUPPLY MANIA. If your child produces a lot of artwork at home, she probably has tons of crayons, markers and other art supplies. Keep it all in a portable box, light enough for your child to be able to transport it from one room into the next. In addition, separate and organize the supplies into separate Zip-lock baggies before putting them in the box. This will keep everything organized and easily accessible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>THE PERFECT GIFT. Kids artwork makes the perfect gift for grandma, grandpa, sister Jane, Aunt Sue, Uncle Jim, and so on. Rather than buying gifts for your child to give to family members, encourage them to give their creations away as special gifts to special people.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

    <p>I love hypnosis and know that it is totally amazing in its ease of use and applications. It is natural and has no nasty side effects at all. It is a state of relaxation and calmness, and makes you feel as if you’ve been on a mini-holiday or had a mental massage.</p>

<p>Hypnosis allows access to the inner workings of your mind, your subconscious mind, the part where instinctive and automatic thought patterns are stored. This in turn enables you to change such thought patterns and their associated feelings and actions quickly and easily. And let’s face it, all of our experiences, EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM, are affected by our thoughts and expectations. We create our own reality through our own thought processes, and the majority of these are instinctual, springing from our subconscious, unbidden by our conscious and logical mind.</p>

<p>Just think of the infinite possibilities which hypnosis provides for you…you can change how you think and how you feel and how you act with the help of hypnosis. You can overcome fears, anxieties and phobias; you can build inner confidence and super-charge your mind for success in EVERYTHING; you can change habits like smoking, nail-biting or over eating…you can do whatever you want to do with a little help from hypnosis. Doesn’t that make you smile? Hypnosis will make you very happy, once you learn to use it.</p>

<p>I said before that one thing I love about hypnosis is its ease of use. It is really simple and straightforward to learn to use hypnosis. You pass through hypnosis every night as you go to sleep. You already use hypnosis, even though you probably weren’t aware of this. You have a natural ability to drift into hypnosis; it “just happens” as you go to sleep. So all you need to learn is how to induce this state of relaxation intentionally, and this is easy to do, simply by listening to hypnosis downloads.</p>

<p>As you listen to your hypnosis download you will be guided into a wonderful state of relaxation, a state which feels totally peaceful and calm. Your muscles will relax and so too will your mind. When in hypnosis you will find it easy of focus on making whatever changes you wish to make, and easily visualize yourself as you want to be – and this will make you smile; this will make you very happy indeed.</p>

<p>I know that you will be happy, because whatever you imagine you will create, quickly and easily. You really do create your own reality, and so you may as well plan what you want to happen, don’t you think?</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2014/07/13/the-world-beneath-your-feet/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">The World Beneath Your Feet</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>There is a complex invisible world beneath your feet and it is necessary to make an effort to develop an appreciation of how the state of the soil affects plant growth.</p>

<p>Soil is a mixture of tiny rock particles, living organisms, chemicals and the remains of dead plants and animals. Spaces between the particles will also contain a certain amount of air and water depending on the type of soil.</p>

<p>Rocks near the earth’s surface are slowly broken down in nature by a process called weathering. Eventually small particles such as sand, silt and clay are formed. These particles create the environment for billions of mostly tiny organisms to live. Larger organisms such as earthworms and insects are also found in soil. A healthy soil is teeming with life.</p>

<p>The main aim as a hobby farmer is thus to try to improve soil health by good management. Poor management can lead to a loss of fertility and degradation of the soil. In extreme cases the valuable topsoil can also be blown or washed away. In the end poor soils lead to low quality crops lacking in nutrition.</p>

<p>Below are examples of some checks I plan to carry out on my farm with the aim of improving soil fertility.</p>

<p>1) Carry out a pH test in different places. This test will determine if the soil is acid, alkaline or neutral. Most plants prefer a pH level around 6.5. Should the pH level be too (below 6) corrections can be made by adding lime. Should the pH be too high (above 7) this can be lowered by adding plenty of organic matter and mulch. Extremely alkaline soils can be changed by adding ground sulphur.</p>

<p>2) Check the soil texture of the soil by rubbing some moist soil between your fingers. This will help to determine the type of soil present. Sandy soils will have a coarse feel. These soils dry quickly. Adding lots of organic matter will improve sandy soils. Very sandy soil can also be improved by adding clay. If the soil feels sticky when rubbed it contains too much clay. Clay soils drain slowly and are difficult to work when wet. Adding gypsum will help in most cases. Should the soil have a good balance of sand, silt and clay you will be blessed with a loamy soil. These soils are generally easy to manage and do not require treatments.</p>

<p>3) Check the level of organic matter in the soil. This can be done by shaking a handful of soil in a jar and seeing how much organic matter floats to the surface. If only a thin layer is present on the surface, lots of organic matter needs to be added. This means more microorganisms can be sustained, these in turn will release essential health giving chemicals needed by plants.</p>

<p>The above tests are simple to carry out and much information is available on these topics. Further tests require equipment or a soil testing company to analyze the soil. These include salinity, especially if bore water is used. Individual soil nutrient levels for Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium as well as trace element levels can also be measured. Other aspects such as fertilizer application and cultivation practices to maintain soil structure also need attention.</p>

<p>Soil care requires years of experience and looking to older gardeners will give you lots of essential tips. Also, experienced gardeners can often identify soil problems by looking at the general appearance of plants. Getting a spade and digging around will give you information about conditions such as water-logging and excessive dryness.</p>

<p>Do all you can to look after your soil and allow your plants to carry out the magic task of turning fertilizers and compost into healthy and nutritious food.</p>

  </header>

    <p>More than 200 known diseases are transmitted through food, and Health Canada estimates that every year approximately two million Canadians suffer from illness caused by food-borne bacteria. While the majority of these cases are mild, Health Canada reports that 2 to 3 percent of all cases will lead to chronic health problems and as many as 30 will die from complications due to food poisoning.</p>

<p>Susan Brunt, a Toronto based family physician and LYSOL spokesperson, reminds us that food safety starts in the home and offers helpful hints on how to keep your home healthy this summer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check expiration dates on all food</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bring food home from the supermarket promptly to refrigerate or freeze</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thaw frozen food in the refrigerator or microwave-not on the counter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use separate cutting boards for raw meats and vegetables to avoid cross-contamination-the accidental spread of germs from food to food or from surface to food</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Disinfect food preparation surfaces with Wipes. They offer a convenient way to prevent cross-contamination in your kitchen and around the grill area</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chill and refrigerate leftovers immediately and use within 2-3 days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Date leftovers to make sure you use them before they spoil</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Dr. Brunt also reminds us that the most severe cases of food poisoning tend to occur in the very old, the very young, and those with weak immune systems.</p>
