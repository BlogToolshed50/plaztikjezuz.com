  </header>

    <p>Now this is a question that we have all pondered at one time or another in our life. Are we willing to look at ourselves and determine if we need a change? Or are we willing to just trudge along as we are – unfulfilled ?</p>

<p>Do we hold on to our negative thoughts? Do we hold grudges? Do we want to seek revenge for those who have hurt or shamed us?</p>

<p>I bet that most of us at some point in our lifetime would have said “Yes” to the above. But I ask you – “What did it gain you?” Did you really feel better by holding on to those negative thoughts?</p>

<p>I would also bet that most of you, if you truly listened to your heart, would say “No”.</p>

<p>Negative thoughts and emotions only make us feel bad. There is no happiness or smiling faces when we have those thoughts. No joy in our hearts. Is this what we really want out of life?</p>

<p>We must be willing to release our old, negative thoughts and beliefs. They are only thoughts that stand in our way of true happiness and joy. Some will say that is easier said than done. Well it is. We are only asking you to REPLACE your negative thoughts with positive ones. Positive thoughts that will give you peace, happiness and fulfillment. When you put all your attention on your positive thoughts, your negative thoughts will lose their focus and value. You don’t necessarily have to give up being hurt or mad at a particular situation or person immediately (this will come eventually), but start to appreciate what you have in life instead.</p>

<p>Appreciation and gratitude are our emotional healers. Grateful thoughts can be very simple as; your home which provides you with warmth and shelter, friends that make you laugh, family who are there for you in times of sorrow or need, pets that just give you unconditional love, jobs that provide you with income, a beautiful day outside that makes you want to enjoy nature or your car that gets you to work everyday. It is amazing at how many things we take for granted that we do not notice to appreciate. When you deliberately plant good thoughts, your entire energy is uplifted. Why? Because when you focus on good thoughts, that is what you will attract in your life. So when those negative thoughts pop up, don’t give them any attention. Laugh them off and immediately replace them with ANY good thoughts at that time.</p>

<p>If you were to appreciate or express gratitude of something that happened to you at least ONCE A DAY for at least 30 days, you would be amazed at how your life could change. Take it a step further and write it down every night before you go to bed. In 30 days, you will be surprised at what you’ll come to know about yourself and like as well. You may even want to explore a 90 day personal development program that will change your life not just for today – but forever. For me, this discovery enabled me to quit my job and enter into an in-home business adventure that is providing me with financial wealth and happiness. It may open the same doors for you.</p>

<p>So, are you willing to let go and BE HAPPY? Try it – you might like it.</p>

<p>Learn how you can achieve all your goals and obtain fulfillment through a personal development business. Create a lucrative and successful home business.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Even if you have organized your retirement to include travel, hikes, golf, bowls, book clubs and grandchildren, after the initial flush of free time fades, you might find that there are periods when you need a little more mental stimulation.</p>

<p>While indulging in your hobbies, with probably a lot more gusto that you previously had time for, you might consider the possibility of actually earning some money from them. Now, I don’t mean selling your wares, but of course if they are easily posted ebay can be a great marketplace for you.</p>

<p>What I am referring to you is selling you knowledge. Whether it is sports, crafts, cookery or photography, you could use your retirement to join thousands of others who are making a profit out of their skills.</p>

<p>The secret to making money from what I’ll call your collective “hobbies” is to approach the project as a labor of love. Love of your hobby.</p>

<p>If you can remember back to the days when you first started your hobby, you were keen to gather as much information as you could about how to master it. Learning about the different methods, patterns, tools etc that could be used was a great adventure. You may still be on the journey!</p>

<p>With the aid of the internet, you are able to share your knowledge not just with your grandchild (who may not be interested anyway) but with people around the world who want to know how to master that particular hobby. Who knows? You could be a master at it, without even knowing.</p>

<p>Writing an e-book is a very easy thing to do, and couples who work together on these projects often enjoy the whole process. Learn how to create a simple website to use as your sales page (don’t be scared – its easy with a capital E) – another great skill that you will use over and over again. Include how-to photos are great – heck you can even make a short “how to” movie with your digital camera and post it on You Tube, linking back to your web page.</p>

<p>There are very easy methods that automate payment and direct download of the document you create.</p>

<p>Take the time to do a Google search to see what information is already available on your hobby, and see if you can do something similar, but better. It’s important to not over-value your e-book or article.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2013/03/25/ways-to-get-your-child-to-listen-to-you-2/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Ways to Get Your Child to Listen to You</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Your Child Won’t Listen to You? You’ve tried reasoning, you’ve tried punishing, you’ve tried bribing, you’ve tried humor – and nothing seems to work? Well, there is hope. Do you think your child is shutting you out and you’re not sure why? Here are 5 Ways to get through to your child.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Listen to your child. No matter how insignificant their little problem is, it is paramount to them. As an adult, it is difficult to put away our own problems and just listen, but it must be done or your child will continue to be one of those problems. When you listen to your child, you validate their importance. Ask your child how their day went, and really listen. Are there other issues going on? Is your child being bullied at school and is afraid or ashamed to talk about it? If he is, you need to make your child feel safe with you, so she can bring it up. If you want your child to listen to you, you need to listen to your child.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Watch their facial expressions. Often they will tell you what they want with facial expressions. Why does he pout when his sister walks in the room? Why does she cry when her big sister is playing with someone else. There are great clues there. You shouldn’t assume he is pouting because he is agitated with his sister – he may want something from her and doesn’t know exactly what it is and is pouting because he feels out of sorts about “it.” Put yourself in their shoes. When they talk to you, are you responding with love and caring in your voice? Or are you always short, curt and demeaning. Think about how you would like to be spoken to, and respond in kind. Not only do your children admire you, they mirror you. If you see a quality in them you dislike, think about where they learned it, and change yourself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let them make decisions. How often do you make decisions for them? You decide what they eat, what they wear, what they’re going to do……OK, so it is important they are guided, but once you teach them the difference, give them some healthy options. Take her to the library and let her choose 5 books to read. You’ll be surprised to learn just what she’s interested in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure they are eating healthy. Do they snack or gummy worms, or apples? Most kids will choose a healthy snack over unhealthy. Don’t even buy the junk food, and allow them to go into the frig all they want for that apple, carrot stick, cheese, hard boiled egg, or small handful of peanuts. Keep plenty of bottles of pure water on hand. Make sure they eat a healthy breakfast that has protein and keep the sugar intake low. No sugar laden-ed cereal for breakfast – give them oatmeal with peaches in it instead. Let them make their own fruit smoothie in the morning. Let them cut up the fruits and vegetables. With your supervision, they will learn to love to eat healthy. And so what if they make a mess? Just calmly tell them, “ok, now let’s wipe up the counter so the bugs won’t come, and here, let’s wash your dishes off.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He won’t clean his room or do his homework? He’s always procrastinating? Don’t just bark the command, “go clean your room!” or “do your homework!” When was the last time you offered to help your youngster clean his room? Make a game out of. “C’mon Johnny, let’s see how many worms or frogs we find in your closet.” Or how about this, “Janie, show me your homework – let’s see what you’re doing.” Often times, the child’s homework may be somewhat challenging to you. Admit it! Ask your child to teach you! When student becomes teacher, they learn too. And your child loves you. When you show even the smallest amount of interest in what they’re doing, they will excel.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Time is the best gift you can give your child. And with time comes a better understanding too. You may spend a few more minutes now interacting with your child, but it will pay off in the long run when your child becomes happy, healthy, successful, and independent.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2013/03/11/what-is-digital-rights-management/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">What is Digital Rights Management?</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Adobe are often keen to suggest that they have been the primary innovator in developing the digital rights management space. Although there is speculation as to extent of which they have contributed, there can be little doubt as to whether or not their file format – PDF – is considered to be the logical common output for documents across many platforms where copy protection is needed.</p>

<p>While many companies have claimed to have had an input into the file security solutions that we find ourselves using today, such as XrML for example, only Adobe have managed to lead with the sheer scale and reach to make their solution resonate and be considered the global standard. With the evolution of on-line retailing environments, the lack of barriers to entry, and other digital communication advancements; it is now more necessary than ever to ensure that digital rights management tackles copyright theft through adding complications and difficulties to the processes used to steal content. Indeed, it is widely acknowledged that DRM software can only stop copyright theft at some levels – for example, DRM cannot stop manual replication (writing your own copy) in the case of e-book copy prevention.</p>

<p>It is said that the primary functions of DRM security software are controlling copying/extraction, printing functionality management and changing after a subsequent save. Such functions are always going to needed where copyright is not surrendered upon receipt of the document. Watermarking – as a copy control and digital rights management solution – is often considered to be surrounded with some uncertainty. In the case of e-book copy prevention, for example, publishers are faced with making a decision where the implementation of watermarking can leave their customers having to sacrifice appearance and usability in return for prevention of black-market distribution. Although the value of this is disputed, we can at least agree that while advancements are under way, such as identifying the purchaser, the video, music and broadcast business do not appear to be moving away from watermarking in a hurry!</p>

<p>As electronic learning methods advance, Adobe have been careful to facilitate comment authoring in tandem with document security, to allow both collaboration and copyright implementation. This is something which is unlikely to have much value in commercial publishing, however Adobe would not want to allow any competitors to eat away at a sub-niche and innovate across the board at the same time.</p>

<p>The middle ground between practicality, reasonableness, and implementation of the rights that come along with copyright assets, can be best depicted by the situation where the 2000 publication of Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland, which did not allow the book to be read aloud – a feature which is widely considered to be an advantage of PDF documents, and an assumed feature when purchasing a digital document. Some claim that such behavior goes against accessibility initiatives, while others suggest that the necessity for document security, coupled with the associated disadvantages of market forces, mean that the decision is one which should be made at the free will of the copyright holder.</p>

When they talk to you, are you responding with love and caring in your voice? Or are you always short, curt and demeaning. Think about how you would like to be spoken to, and respond in kind. Not only do your children admire you, they mirror you. If you see a quality in them you dislike, think about where they learned it, and change yourself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let them make decisions. How often do you make decisions for them? You decide what they eat, what they wear, what they’re going to do……OK, so it is important they are guided, but once you teach them the difference, give them some healthy options. Take her to the library and let her choose 5 books to read. You’ll be surprised to learn just what she’s interested in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure they are eating healthy. Do they snack or gummy worms, or apples? Most kids will choose a healthy snack over unhealthy. Don’t even buy the junk food, and allow them to go into the frig all they want for that apple, carrot stick, cheese, hard boiled egg, or small handful of peanuts. Keep plenty of bottles of pure water on hand. Make sure they eat a healthy breakfast that has protein and keep the sugar intake low. No sugar ladened cereal for breakfast – give them oatmeal with peaches in it instead. Let them make their own fruit smoothie in the morning. Let them cut up the fruits and vegetables. With your supervision, they will learn to love to eat healthy. And so what if they make a mess? Just calmly tell them, “ok, now let’s wipe up the counter so the bugs won’t come, and here, let’s wash your dishes off.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He won’t clean his room or do his homework? He’s always procrastinating? Don’t just bark the command, “go clean your room!” or “do your homework!” When was the last time you offered to help your youngster clean his room? Make a game out of. “C’mon Johnny, let’s see how many worms or frogs we find in your closet.” Or how about this, “Janie, show me your homework – let’s see what you’re doing.” Often times, the child’s homework may be somewhat challenging to you. Admit it! Ask your child to teach you! When student becomes teacher, they learn too. And your child loves you. When you show even the smallest amount of interest in what they’re doing, they will excel.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Time is the best gift you can give your child. And with time comes a better understanding too. You may spend a few more minutes now interacting with your child, but it will pay off in the long run when your child becomes happy, healthy, successful, and independent.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Communicating with children of any age is probably the key parenting skill, as it helps build their self-esteem and confidence.</p>

<p>Through parenting we can prepare our children to survive and thrive in their environment. The environment that today’s society provides children is full of challenges and big issues like drugs, violence, and sex. That is why it is so important for children and parents to communicate openly.</p>

<p>Communication takes both talking and listening. Listening, instead of lecturing, gives children space to share their feelings, and by sorting through their own problems can help with their decision making skills. Further, good communication helps children develop confidence, feelings of self-worth, and good relationships with others.</p>

<p>At every age children need their parents to understand how they’re feeling. It’s your job to make your child feel that she can talk to you about anything going on in her life. You achieve this by listening properly and not leaping in with your own judgments or constantly blaming your child.</p>

<p>You want to be wise and prepared when you talk to your teen. Here are tips that can help. Good communication helps children and parents to develop confidence, feelings of self-worth, and good relationships with others. Try these tips:</p>

<p>• Teach children to listen… gently touch a child before you talk… say their name.</p>

<p>• Eat at least one meal together per day. Mealtime allows for two-way conversation and family bonding</p>

<p>• Use time in the car wisely. Turn mom’s taxi service into an opportunity for stimulating conversation!</p>

<p>• Speak in a quiet voice… whisper sometimes so children have to listen… they like this.</p>

<p>• Host a family night each week. With a little effort, most families can set aside one evening per week for family activity.</p>

<p>• Practice listening and talking: talk with your family about what you see on TV, hear on the radio or see at the park or store. (Talk with your children about school and their friends.)</p>

<p>• Organize a 10-minute family time before bed each evening to cuddle on the sofa and affirm your love for your children.</p>

<p>• Look a child in the eyes so you can tell when they understand… bend or sit down… become the child’s size.</p>

<p>• Host family meetings to give your children a forum in which their input matters.</p>

<p>• Express positive emotions. It takes more than just words to communicate positively. Studies show that only 7 percent of our message is through our words while 38 percent is through our tone of voice and 55 percent is through our posture and facial expressions!</p>

<p>• Be conscious of how your communication affects your children. Children take cues from you as how to treat others in the family, as well as how to act outside the home.</p>

<p>Many parents only see their children when they’re at home. Get involved with your child’s school. Volunteer to help with extracurricular programs, such as theater or sports. You may discover new and wonderful aspects to your child that you otherwise would have missed.</p>
