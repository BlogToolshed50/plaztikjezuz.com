A chronic coughs is the right symptom which indicates the presence of the infection in the body.</p>

<p>It is confirmed that TB becomes active one in 20 cases and leads to death if unattended on time. It is an astonishing and agonizing fact that one individual gets affected by TB per second in the world. As much as 13.70 million chronic active cases, 9.3 million new cases were found in 2007. In all 1.8 million people died due to TB in the year 2007.</p>

<p>Most of the affected people are found in developing countries and the middle east. People with HIV infection are easily prone to TB attack and die fast as revealed in various studies. Despite various steps and the technological improvement and medicines scientists are not confident to eradicate these diseases completely even by 2050. However, it is a solace to the human that the novel vaccines, improved drugs coupled with the excellent diagnostic facilities we can hope for the reduction in the incidence of the disease in the future.</p>
