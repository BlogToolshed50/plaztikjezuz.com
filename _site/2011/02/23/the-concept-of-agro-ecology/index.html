    <p>In the days to come, it is a must that the world should think and practice the ecological agriculture to sustain the growth and ensure food security without spoiling the environment. If you look at the various methods like growing the insect trapping plants in country like Kenya and the extensive use of the ducks by the Bangladeshi farmers to eat the weeds in the rice field, the awareness is slowly creeping on to the minds of the people and scientists to go in for the Eco-friendly cultural practices to sustain the growth in a balanced way. To feed the expected seven billion mouths by this year and about nine billion by 2050 without affecting the environment and depletion of the natural wealth, it is imperative that we adopt such ecological agriculture to produce what we need without much environmental issues.</p>

<p>In fact, many experts have cautioned that we should avoid the oil dependent model of industrial farming leading to the environmental disintegration. The researchers and the agricultural scientists re affirmed the truth that “Agroecology” can help the farms to become more resilient to the possible climatic changes like flood, drought and various soil and water related issues. If only the farming in the future is done as a sound ecological farming, it can easily boost the production and contribute better than the conventional farming. It is a matter to be followed by farmers of other countries by seeing the rice growers in Indonesia, Vietnam and Bangladesh who use the local knowledge to reduce the use of the insecticides to an extent of 35 to 92 percent without affecting the yield. The ecological agriculture is certainly going to reduce the cost of agriculture and improve the food quality as well.</p>
