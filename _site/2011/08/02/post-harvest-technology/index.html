    <p>Post harvest technology is becoming more important in the context of increasing demand for the food materials. It is estimated that as much as 30% of the total food produced is wasted in the absence of proper and appropriate post harvest technology to preserve the products. In the case of fruit crops the wastage is too much as they are perishable in nature. Likewise the flower that is harvested is to be properly preserved to have longer life. Recently the agricultural departments in various countries are coming out with chemical and biological treatment of the harvested crops to prevent them from deteriorating fast.</p>
