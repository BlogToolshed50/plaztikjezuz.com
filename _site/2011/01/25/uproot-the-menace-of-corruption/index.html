    <p>It is something every one of should seriously think about and play the role expected of us to uproot the menace of corruption in this world. Of late, the data are alarming and the incidence of corruption is very much on the rise. Many countries have increased their level of corruption. Bribery and scandalous business is on the increase in many countries. The latest data I came across, Chad leads the list of corrupt nations. This country is adjoining the poorest nation Sudan as the study indicates. It is quite interesting to observe that the level of poverty is directly proportional to the level of corruption.</p>

<p>Also is a point of consideration that the level is very high in the nations were the dictatorship is prevalent for a longer period. Chad is an appropriate example for the same as it is under dictatorship for the past 19 years. Yet, another observation is that the countries that are getting foreign assistance in plenty are also in the list of most corrupt nations. It is paining to note that countries like Venezuela and Cambodia are in the top 10 list.</p>

<p>The world bank report as much as 5%($2.6 Trillion) of the global GDP is used for bribes and it is virtually stolen from the taxpayer’s money. Corruption leads to social economic effect in preventing foreign investments into a country for its development. In fact, nations like Canada and Japan are also cited in the report of Transparency international as the nations having corruption. In democratic countries the corruption by the bureaucracy is also found to be rampant. It is high time the rulers and that are ruled devote their attention to eliminate this evil from this world.</p>
