    <p>The scientific invention goes unabated due to the inquisitiveness of the researchers to explore the world to the core. The recent news from NASA has revealed the presence of the relatively small planets and stable multi planet systems which are more plentiful than the previous searches showed. Latest data from the Kepler telescope on more than 1000 possible new planets outside our solar system actually doubled the count of what our astronomers call as exoplanets. They have not been confirmed as the planets yet, but some astronomers estimate that 90 percent of what Kepler has found will eventually verified. Kepler was launched since 2009 and has been conducting the census since then to find out the presence of earth like planets.</p>

<p>It has found there are more planets that are much smaller than Jupiter than the giant planets. Some of these planets even found to approach the size of the earth. It gives an indication that they are potential planets for living creatures. Yale University exoplanet expert Debra Fischer confirmed the fact that there is eventual hope for worlds that could harbor life. With the increasing population and the dearth of the scarce resources on earth, the ambition of the humans to find the alternative planet to live may become a reality since the findings of Kepler goes in the right direction as say by many experts in this field. Though Mother Earth has very thing to meet the need of every one of us, it looks insufficient to meet our greed. Hence, the search for the alternative will continue forever.</p>
