    <p>Every nation has been craving for the globalization over the past decade and achieved certain advantages by resorting to the principle of globalization. It ensured the greater movement of goods, people, capital and even ideas due to the increased trade and investment. The globalization has led to a board members less trade and world. Economic boom was achieved by many countries through the opening achieved by globalization and the exports and imports could show tremendous progress. Many countries could reduce the poverty level with the increased GDP and trade surplus due to the globalization.</p>

<p>On the other side of the picture there were certain social and economic costs the nations were compelled to pay on account of the globalization. The trade liberalization achieved through the globalization rewarded the competitive industries while the weaker and non competitive industries and trades were punished owing to the price war. Increased travels and trade because of the opening has led to the spread of various dreaded diseases for both human and animals. In fact, the interdependence of the countries on the economic front resulted in various financial crisis as witnessed in Asia during 2008. In all the nations should wake up to the call and regulate the aspect of globalization to reap more benefits for the humans rather than inviting unwarranted rivalry and issues.</p>
