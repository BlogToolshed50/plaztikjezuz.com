    <p>When everyone needs to go in for the online transfer of money from their bank accounts, the needed care is to be taken to do it in a safer way. I read in a news item that it has become easier for the fraudsters to hack the internet banking password by capturing your keystrokes on your key board. This has been made possible through couple of programs called “spyware” and Trojan Programs. They are said to be made to capture the strokes of your key board. These software are often installed through the downloads to capture the confidential data without your knowledge. Experts say that these software are often created in the PC of the users whenever they download certain free downloads or MP3 or even movie downloads. These software can even disable the anti virus software in your system.</p>

<p>You can avoid such hacking if you use the virtual key board as suggested by those in these field. Virtual key board is an online application, which substitutes the actual keyboard with a mouse. When you click on the virtual keyboard at the time of online banking, the monitor will flash the key board for your use. The virtual key board is able top protect your account or card information and pass word from such fraudsters. Banks often give you the choice to use the virtual key board. In a scrambled key pad, the position of the keys on the virtual key board keep changing every time you sign in. This makes the camera to capture the exact letters for the password and the hackers cannot easily do the fraud. Changing the password often is yet another way of protecting from such fraudulent activities by others.</p>
