    <p>Cereal is a worldwide trusted and traditional breakfast and is the safest bet for the busy lifestyle we lead. It is readily available, easy to fix, digest and is healthy as it is low in calories. Truth is that most of the “low fat “cereals” available will not make you lose weight. But they contain less fat than their counterparts with good amount of calories. It is better that we eat much them during the coffee break and even use them as snacks during evening hours while watching the TV. It is proven that twenty three of the top 27 break fast cereals that are marketed in us for the children are an essential form of energy providing the iron, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and much more to take care of the healthy life.</p>

<p>Even the commercial brands tempting you with healthy additions such as oats, honey, nuts, and vanilla are not necessarily healthy than their natural counterparts. You have to judge yourself by experimenting them, compared to the natural ones. If you have cereals once in a day, it can have a remarkable influence on your health. You should choose the right cereals to meet out your requirement. Always choose the whole grain that contains at least 3g fibre in the form of bran, oatmeal and oats. The fiber found in the whole cereals helps make you full and keeps the hunger at bay. The whole grains also lower the risk of heart diseases and diabetes and reduces the weight gain. In all it is better that bet on whole grain to thwart various health issues.</p>
