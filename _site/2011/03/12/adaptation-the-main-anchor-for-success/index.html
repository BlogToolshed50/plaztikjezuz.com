    <p>Many successful people on earth vouched that the “Adaptation” to the changing situation has helped them be so. It is said that, nature is in constant flux. It is perpetually trying to evolve and rebuild itself to accommodate the myriad species which populate it canvass. If you look around you, you can observe millions of species, each festooned with a uniqueness often bemusing us. Every single one of them plays a significant role in maintaining the nature. How they do it?. How they were able to surpass the vagaries of the nature?. The answer is simple —it is by Adaptation. They all have adapted to the changing and ever dynamic environment and started to survive nicely.</p>

<p>It is nothing but a lesson to the human being to adapt themselves to the changing situations and the challenges in the life. In the modern world we often encounter various situations and we need to act differently. The obvious solution may not be the right one. Such circumstances may stretch and vitiate our infallibility. It may deride us of our confidence. There is a possibility of losing ourselves in the process. The only way out is by adapting to the situation and learning to survive in extremities. Hence, one should develop the ability to adapt to the changing situation and the challenges to emerge victorious.</p>
