    <p>Prevention is better than cure is the dictum that everyone tries to adopt, but fail to succeed due to lethargic attitude. Boosting your immune system helps you overcome many contagious disease and health issues like cold, flu and cough. When the weather cools, it is the right time to kick start the health. Your immune system is the natural defense system. It is able to protect the body against infection from bacteria and viruses from all over the world. When you are ill the immunity helps you fight the infection easily. For most of us, giving our immune system a kick start usually begins and ends with popping the Vitamin C supplements. Vitamin C helps you to boost our immunity to bugs. Foods are better than dietary supplements for the prevention of cold and flu.</p>

<p>For example, eating an orange is better than taking a vitamin C pills or supplement. Orange offers a combination of nutrients like magnesium, potassium and fiber. Eating vegetables and fruits rich in vitamin C helps you develop the immune system. The citrus fruits in particular are the great source of antioxidants which helps to combat the toxins and boost the immune system. A healthy food rich in zinc, magnesium and vitamin B are very useful to ensure the best immune system against various infections and you can lead a happy life without any hassle. A simple attention towards developing your immune system will keep the doctor away.</p>
