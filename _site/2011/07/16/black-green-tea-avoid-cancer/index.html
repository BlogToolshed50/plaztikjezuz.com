    <p>If you are a habitual drinker of either black or green tea every day, you need not worry as it is found by the researchers in the USA and India that they are capable of fighting against the cancer. Yes, consumption of the black tea as found in the study by the US researchers is seen to help shrink the tumors. The antioxidants packed in the green and black tea can easily fight the harmful molecules accumulating in our system and damaging the cells.</p>

<p>Indeed, you can get the effect of eating five portions of vegetable or apple numbering two by simply taking two cups of the green or black tea daily as found in the recent studies. The poly-phenols in black and green tea is found to have positive effects in reducing the breast cancer in females as a result of a study by the Indian scientists. Maybe, the extensive clinical study in the days to come on the effects of the green and black tea in killing the cancer cells is sure to be a panacea of those suffering from the dreaded disease.</p>
