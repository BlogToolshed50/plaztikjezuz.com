    <p>Progress is being made on the home-front for those caring for family members suffering from Alzheimer’s or dementia. Currently, about two-thirds of Americans with those conditions are cared for at home.</p>

<p>As the disease progresses it carries with it a tremendous burden, both physically and psychologically on the family members-usually the husband, wife or partner–who are doing the care-giving. That is why it is vital that the family access community support systems, such as local Alzheimer’s organizations, that can provide reassurance and support groups.</p>

<p>It is also important that family caregivers seek outside help if they feel they are becoming ill from the strain of care-giving as the disease progresses. The strain can easily become intolerable for spouses trying to cope all alone at home with an Alzheimer’s sufferer and they themselves can have a physical or mental breakdown.</p>

<p>There should be no shame or guilt in seeking respite care from a professional home care agency. People who are not trained professionals often find it a strain to be caregivers, and should not feel that this makes them a bad or unloving partner or child. By turning to outside resources, a family can delay having to place Alzheimer’s sufferers in a long-term-care facility and, instead, keep them in the comfort of their own home.</p>

<p>Interim Health-Care has formed a strategic partnership with the Alzheimer’s Foundation of America (AFA) to support AFA’s goals related to dementia care professionals, including:</p>

<p>Raise the level of professional care provided to individuals who are suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and dementia;</p>

<p>Support professionals as they support those in need by providing practical training;</p>

<p>Set standards of excellence through the AFA qualification program;</p>

<p>Offer networking and advocacy opportunities.</p>

<p>A leader in the home health-care industry, recognizes the special needs of Alzheimer’s and dementia patients and their families. Creating an Alzheimer’s- and dementia-friendly and safe environment is an important step in making it possible for people to remain at home much longer and further into the disease.</p>
