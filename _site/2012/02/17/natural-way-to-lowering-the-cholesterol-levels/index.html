    <p>The individual should not forget to have some fruits and vegetables as well since these are rich in sterols that are known to keep the cholesterol levels down. All of these products are affordable and can easily be purchased in the supermarket.</p>

<p>Aside from eating properly, the person must also take the necessary precautions when consuming liquids. This means drinking a glass of red wine moderately, reducing the consumption of beer, drinking fresh juices, non-fat milk and water.</p>

<p>Apple juice for example has been known to reduce cholesterol levels by up to 50% when taken regularly. Other fruits can also do the same so cutting this and putting it into a blender can do the trick or getting this in bottled form.</p>

<p>The next step to lowering the cholesterol levels naturally is through exercise. This can be achieved in many ways such as brisk walking, jogging or running around the neighborhood. Learning a new sport and doing it regularly is another option.</p>

<p>Those who want to be looked after by a personal trainer can check out the gym since there are professionals that can create a program to achieve the person’s desired results. This will be a combination of Cardio-vascular exercises as well as weight lifting to burn the calories and lower the cholesterol levels.</p>

<p>There is another way to reduce the cholesterol levels but is only used as a last resort if these two do not work. The individual will be required to use medicine to make it happen. There are a lot of products out there and studies have shown this can drop the cholesterol levels by as much as 15% to 30%.</p>

<p>The person should be aware though that these drugs have certain side effects so it is best to consult a doctor first to make sure it is safe to use.</p>

<p>Cholesterol is something that is produced in the body and is also taken when food is eaten. The only way to make sure the levels in the blood doesn’t exceed the limit is to have a checkup regularly and watch the food that is being cooked or served in the restaurant.</p>
