    <p>Experts believe there is tremendous potential for solar energy. Anything could be possible with the sun?s energy. It provides heat for our swimming pools, rivers, lakes and ponds. It is as a basic as hanging your laundry out on the line and it being dried by the sun. However we have been unable to harness it as a natural source of energy that can be used efficiently.</p>

<p>Scientists believe it is the best alternative source of power. This energy is drawn from heat that strikes the earth. Solar energy has been around for millions of years and it is safe for the environment. It can be renewed and concentrated. Experts are considering it as a viable alternative energy source so it can be used world wide.</p>

<p>It is being used across the world. Inherently, the sun provides a natural heat source which can be used to control temperature without converting it. TO be used for electricity, it needs to be collected and converted. There are different forms of solar energy.</p>

<p>There is widespread use of solar panels to heat houses. Experts have been experimenting and have used solar energy to power cars, unsuccessfully. The technology is not quite there yet. You will not be seeing solar powered cars anytime in the near future. However some experts believe it may be around the corner.</p>

<p>Once captured, solar power, changes and distributes the sun’s power so it can be used for heat and ventilation. A tromp wall is an example of this. It uses solar heat with a system made up of channels of air that are between a window and wall. Then the sun heats the area and circulates through vents and then stores the heat. At night, this stored heat is utilized.</p>

<p>Solar power is dense and is quite an efficient use of power. These facilities could be set up across the world and they are maintenance free. The operating cost is very reasonable after the initial installation. Australia has spent millions of dollars on a solar powered energy station. It is currently generating clean electricity to well over 40,000 locations in the small town of Victoria. It’s very energy efficient and safe for the environment due to there being no gas emissions.</p>

<p>There are other options for solar power such as PV systems. It is connected to an electrical grid and when there is an excess of energy it transfers to another grid. This is extremely efficient and cost effective. The PV cells are set up as a solar panel, and they have become more efficient and the cost of them has gone down tremendously. The designs have improved so that the harnessed sunlight can be focused on a centralized point. The size of the cells decrease as efficiency rises.</p>
