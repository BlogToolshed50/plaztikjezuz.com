    <p>Marketing is an extremely important thing from point of view of the growth of any company. One needs to be innovative and market his or her product in the most attractive way possible. If you stay under the impression that it’s just business and don’t start advertising properly then you may face some losses as you wont gain enough customers. Many people think of starting up their own small business but only the few who market it well go ahead and become successful. If you don’t market your business you could end up going bankrupt. Given below are some marketing strategies that may come in handy to help you market your small business.</p>

<p>1: Manage time properly and think big:</p>

<p>You should not at all care about the size of your business whether it is small or large. You should always think big and feel like you are the most successful man or woman on this earth. This will help develop confidence in yourself and also in your customers. You should spend as much time as possible on your customers satisfying all their needs because word of mouth publicity is the best marketing that you can do.</p>

<p>2: Maintain uniqueness:</p>

<p>You should try and do something unique for your customers. Many shopping malls provide you with free car washing or free crèches while you shop. Obviously, people will prefer to go to this mall rather than any mall available quite close by to their homes. Thus, you must maintain uniqueness in your services. One should always remember that when you give something extra, you gain something extra.</p>

<p>3: Relate to your customers:</p>

<p>Forming a good relationship with your customers can help make you gain more business. Make a record of their birthdays and anniversaries and mail them regularly on any festivals. While you mail them don’t forget to add your address and contact number at the end of the mail making sure that they will contact you as soon as they need to. Customers are the ones who help us advertise ourselves, thus to keep them happy is an extremely important duty for your small business.</p>

<p>4: Keep a track through the internet:</p>

<p>Try and collect the email addresses of all your customers as a part of your marketing campaign. You can always send an e-mail of lucrative offers to them. They will make use of these offers and will in turn let their friends know and you could get more customers.</p>

<p>5: Check your employees:</p>

<p>Having rude and unhelpful employees may cost you a lot of business. Especially the staff of your company that deals with the customers should be polite and nice and should always be ready to help. This may help develop your reputation.</p>

<p>6: Make online sales and advertisements:</p>

<p>You should make buying and selling services available on your website and put up ads on all possible websites for the convenience of your customers to find you and to gain more customers. Research’s say that the online market has gone up by a huge ratio in the recent years and as the experts say you should be in touch with the fast moving world but also don’t forget other methods of reaching your customers like PR or newspaper advertising for instance.</p>
