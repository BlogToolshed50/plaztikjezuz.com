    <p>Despite being triggered by external factors, stress in actuality is produced by your own mind. It is a result of your desire to achieve something or comply with a specific standard or requirement. And because we can never expect to thrive without abiding by one set of standards or another, it is typical that your day to day activities would make up your daily dose of stress.</p>

<p>But the kind of stress that compels you to achieve or perform accordingly are expected and necessitated. On its own, it is enough to use up your energy reserves. It is the unwanted and useless stress you unconsciously encumber yourself with that you must learn to handle and do away with.</p>

<p>The Importance of Being and Staying Rational</p>

<p>What sets man apart from beasts is his rationality. However, despite the privilege to exercise his reasoning to handle his affairs effectively, too often a time, he burdens himself with irrational thoughts. All of which adds up to unwarranted stress. And as he fusses about the minutest and least insignificant of details, he blames anything and everything for his stressful woes. Everything except himself that is.</p>

<p>It is the unwanted irrational thoughts that you often obsess about that unnecessarily add to your mental burden. And it goes without mentioning, that you should learn to distinguish and discard them on the spot. Common examples of these are the following: being overly finical with your appearance, obsessing about the tiniest insignificant detail that is really unimportant to begin with, sacrificing too much just so that you can please everybody literally, and corrupting your mind with too many “what ifs” or “what could best”.</p>

<p>Uncluttered your mind by ridding yourself of these kinds of irrational thoughts that do not hold water. When you find yourself under attack by them; stop them right then and there, breathe in, and focus on being still until such time that all those voices in your head are silenced. Only when your mind is still should you give yourself the chance to sift through each one, so as to segregate the important ones from those that aren’t.</p>
