    <p>Ways to Develop your intuition</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Recognition</strong>: I have relied on intuition for making most of my major decisions but I still have difficulty sometimes distinguishing between it and just a passing thought, so here are some guidelines I use?</li>
</ol>

<p>a. <strong>Feeling</strong>: What’s the feeling around it? If it’s gentle that’s usually a sign of intuition. Something that is fear-based and urgent is not intuition.</p>

<p>b. <strong>Persistent</strong>: You find that you keep having the same thought about something, check it out.</p>

<p>c. <strong>Messages</strong>: You find that the issue crops up again in all sorts of ways..it gets mentioned on the news, you hear it in passing conversation.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Trust</strong>. So after you have got these messages and confirmation, if you wish to use this, you actually need to do something about it. You must learn to trust this feeling. Follow promptings and see where they lead you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Openness</strong>: Be open to where intuition can lead you. One thing I can promise you..is that you will be surprised and delighted by where it leads you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sometimes it doesn’t mean anything</strong>. This is one thing I have noticed about being guided by intuition. Sometimes hunches and gut instincts don’t actually seem to mean anything…but we don’t know that until after-wards…so accept that you may have the odd intuitive red herring!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So this week begin paying attention to your hunches. Call that friend, read that book, make that call…and who knows what delightful things could come to your door..</p>
