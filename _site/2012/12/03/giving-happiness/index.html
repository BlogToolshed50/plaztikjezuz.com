    <p>We all want happiness. We all desire appreciation. We all crave for recognition. We all want to be applauded. We all need to be called as good and lovely human beings. We are all looking for this certificate from our friends, family and our partner. This makes us happy. This makes us feel good about ourselves. This gives us new confidence in ourselves. This all gives us a new and positive self esteem, which is very important. How to get it?</p>

<p>Let us do all this for others. If no one is praising us, let us praise others. Let us do all that we want others to do to us. Let us give love, affection, appreciation, and let us applaud others even for a very small victory. Will this help us? It helps us immediately. The first feeling we get after doing a good deed is that of satisfaction. This raises our self esteem. This makes us feel good. By making others happy, we get happiness. So let us become proactive and get all we want by not asking for it, but giving it.</p>

<p>What about those who get such praise from us? They will feel very happy. They will be happy with us. They will like us even more. They will like to do something in return. They will do all that we have been wishing for. Send happiness to get happiness. The shortest route to a lovely life.</p>

<p>Here are some immediate resources for you. Send e-cards across to whoever you can think of. Within few days, your own inbox will be full of messages of praise, love and applause. The e-cards for Congratulate, Good Day, Thinking of you, and Thank You. Happiness is a state of mind. We feel happy when we feel contented with ourselves..In a happy state,one feels cheerful with one’s life and circumstances.</p>

<p>Remaining unhappy is not our goal in life, but happiness is our goal. If we are not happy, life become a burden. In an unhappy state, one lives, but only because one has no other choice. Why not make happiness a part of everyday living? Giving pain to a friend or anyone for that matter is a crime against humanity, provided that pain is undeserved. Even if the pain or punishment is deserved by anyone, we can always try and forgive. Better to focus on giving happiness to others. By giving happiness, we get it in return manifold.</p>
