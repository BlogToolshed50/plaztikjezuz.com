    <p>Trust and confidence in top leadership was the single most reliable predictor of employee satisfaction in an organization.</p>

<p>Effective communication by leadership in three critical areas was the key to winning organizational trust and confidence:</p>

<p>Helping employees understand the company’s overall business strategy.</p>

<p>Helping employees understand how they contribute to achieving key business objectives.</p>

<p>Sharing information with employees on both how the company is doing and how an employee’s own division is doing – relative to strategic business objectives.</p>

<p>So in a nutshell — you must be trustworthy and you have to be able to communicate a vision of where the organization needs to go. The next section, “Principles of Leadership”, ties in closely with this key concept.</p>

<p>Principles of Leadership</p>

<p>To help you be, know, and do; (U.S. Army, 1973) follow these eleven principles of leadership (later chapters in this guide expand on these and provide tools for implementing them):</p>

<p>Know yourself and seek self-improvement – In order to know yourself, you have to understand your be, know, and do, attributes. Seeking self-improvement means continually strengthening your attributes. This can be accomplished through self-study, formal classes, reflection, and interacting with others.</p>

<p>Be technically proficient – As a leader, you must know your job and have a solid familiarity with your employees’ tasks.</p>

<p>Seek responsibility and take responsibility for your actions – Search for ways to guide your organization to new heights. And when things go wrong, they always do sooner or later — do not blame others. Analyze the situation, take corrective action, and move on to the next challenge.</p>

<p>Make sound and timely decisions – Use good problem solving, decision making, and planning tools.</p>

<p>Set the example – Be a good role model for your employees. They must not only hear what they are expected to do, but also see. We must become the change we want to see – Mahatma Gandhi</p>

<p>Know your people and look out for their well-being – Know human nature and the importance of sincerely caring for your workers.</p>

<p>Keep your workers informed – Know how to communicate with not only them, but also seniors and other key people.</p>

<p>Develop a sense of responsibility in your workers – Help to develop good character traits that will help them carry out their professional responsibilities.</p>

<p>Ensure that tasks are understood, supervised, and accomplished – Communication is the key to this responsibility.</p>

<p>Train as a team – Although many so called leaders call their organization, department, section, etc. a team; they are not really teams…they are just a group of people doing their jobs.</p>

<p>Use the full capabilities of your organization – By developing a team spirit, you will be able to employ your organization, department, section, etc. to its fullest capabilities.</p>

<p>Factors of leadership</p>

<p>There are four major factors in leadership:</p>

<p>Follower</p>

<p>Different people require different styles of leadership. For example, a new hire requires more supervision than an experienced employee. A person who lacks motivation requires a different approach than one with a high degree of motivation. You must know your people! The fundamental starting point is having a good understanding of human nature, such as needs, emotions, and motivation. You must come to know your employees’ be, know, and do attributes.</p>
