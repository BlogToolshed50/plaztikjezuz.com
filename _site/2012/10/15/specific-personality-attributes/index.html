    <p>We want to evaluate more carefully specific personality attributes that have been found to be powerful predictors of behavior in organizations. The first is related to where a person perceives the locus of control, Self-confidence, self monitoring, and propensity for risk taking.</p>

<p>Locus of control some people believe that they are masters of their own fate. Other people see themselves as pawns of fate, believing that what happens to them in their lives is due to luck and chance. the first type who believe that they control their destinies, have been labeled internals, whereas the later, who see their lives as being controlled by outside forces, have been called externals. A person’s perception of the source of his or her fate is turned locus of control.</p>

<p>a large amount of research comparing internals with externals has consistently shown that individuals who have high scores in externalize are less satisfied with their job, have higher absenteeism rates, are more alienated from the work setting, and are less involved on their jobs than are internals.</p>

<p>The overall evidence indicates that internals generally perform better on their jobs, but that conclusion should be moderated to reflect differences in jobs. Internals search more effectively for information before making decision, are more motivated to achieve, and make a greater attempt to control their environment. Externals, however, are more complaint and willing to follow directions.</p>

<p>Self-confidence people differ in the degree to which they like or dislike themselves. This trait is called self-confidence. This is directly related to expectation for success. High self-confidence believe that they possess the ability they need in order to succeed at work.</p>

<p>Individuals with high self-confidence will take more risks in job selection and are more likely to choose unconventional jobs than people with low self-confidence. The most generalizable finding on self-confidence is that low self-confidence are more susceptible to external influence than are high self-confidence. Low self-confidence depend on the receipt of positive evaluation from others. As a result, they are more likely to seek approval from others and more prone to conform to the beliefs and behavior of those they respect than are high self-confidence.</p>

<p>Self-monitoring it refers to an individual’s ability to adjust his or her behavior to external, situational factors.</p>

<p>Individuals with high in self-monitoring show considerable adaptability in adjusting their behavior to external situational factors. They are highly sensitive to external cues and can behave differently in different situations. High self-monitors are capable of presenting sticking contradictions between their public persona and their private self. Low self-monitors can’t disguise themselves in that way. They need to display their true dispositions and attitudes in every situation; hence, there is high behavioral consistency between who they are and what they do.</p>

<p>Risk taking people differ in their willingness to take chances. This propensity to assume or avoid risk has been shown to have an impact on how long it takes managers to make a decision and how much information they require before making their choice. High risk taking managers make more rapid decisions and use less information in making their choices than do low risk-taking managers.</p>
