    <p>Sleep is the most important aspect for maintaining both Health and Wealth in the life of the human beings. When does a man sleep? He sleeps only when his inner mind or his soul, his sensory organs like ears, eyes, mouth, etc., stop their daily functioning. Sound sleep is one which is had at the proper time. To have proper health, one should have sound sleep. Some people can sleep at any place. Say in the train, bus, in the office, on the floor, immediately after getting into the bed. Such people seem to be extremely lucky as they can enjoy sleep which helps them keep good health. But others who do not get to enjoy this kind of sleep can read some tips given below.</p>

<p>Avoid eating late at night After having dinner, walk for sometime. This allows the food to digest. Read good novels. Sleep 2 hours after having food.</p>

<p>When you come home from work, have bath. Apply powder all over your body. This soaks water from your body and keeps skin dry. Wear loose comfortable clothes.</p>

<p>Before going to bed apply oil to your head. Every alternate day put oil in your ears, then wait for some time and allow the excess oil to drip down. Massage oil to your feet also.</p>

<p>While in bed forget about your day’s incidences. Relax. If you are unable to relax and sleep, then just keep your eyes closed and think nothing. Sleep on your left side.</p>

<p>Sleep in the east west direction. Do not sleep with the feet in the south direction. Change your bed sheet daily.</p>

<p>To summaries, sleeping is important for a healthy living.</p>
