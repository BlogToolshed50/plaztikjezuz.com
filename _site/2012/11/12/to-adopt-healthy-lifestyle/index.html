    <p>In the past it was not uncommon to find meat in every other dish prepared. But, things are changing now and health concerns being one major reason for such change. Animals are chemically injected to beef up and such chemicals are affecting their health and in turn ours. Also, the studies and researches showing negative health results for people consuming meat is an eye opener. Awareness regarding cruelty in animal killing for meat production has been another reason for people turning vegetarians.</p>

<p>Though there are points raised in favors of meat such as the protein and the nutrition content. Such points are put to rest with the fact that many healthier options are still available in vegetarian mode. Tofu, Soya bean are some of the premium source of proteins and are great alternates to the meat foods. The meat food being high on calorie count is the major source of fat accumulation in the body and thus obesity, the most troubling problem for people around the globe. Vegetarian recipes are relatively low on calories and good for health.</p>

<p>Common perception says that vegetarian dishes being low on calorie count are tasteless and boring to eat. But, a change in the cooking method is all take to change the taste buds. Meat burgers are a favorite with everyone. Turning to vegetarian mode can be quite painful for some. A healthier option is to enjoy the burger but, replacing meat with the vegetable content. Vegetarian black bean burgers are a great alternate to the meat hamburgers. Tofu, of Chinese origin, is considered the best alternate to meat in our diets. Tofu scramble is a great source of protein similar to scrambled eggs. Both black bean burger and tofu scramble are easy recipes to prepare.</p>

<p>It is always advised to include nuts in our daily diets to keep nutrition on high levels. Cashews, raisins, apricot, almonds are some nuts that are used as toppings as well. They can be consumed raw or integrating them in the preparation of easy recipes is another option. Raw cashew cheese is one of the recipes using nuts in preparation. Soaking them overnight and then consuming is easy on the digestive process and thus preferred. Soaking nuts while preparing raw cashew cheese is recommended to make it easier for nuts to blend in the mixture prepared.</p>

<p>Not all people are comfortable with the idea of switching to vegetarian food after all these years of eating meat. And changes in the dietary habits can affect health also. It is so advised to consult a dietitian who will help out to list vegetarian recipes that are high on protein and low on calorie count.</p>
