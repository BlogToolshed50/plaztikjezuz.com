      <a class="post-link" href="/2012/10/01/spiti-%e2%80%93-the-hidden-valley/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Spiti – The Hidden Valley</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>For almost a year, now, we had been planning to visit Spiti; the hidden valley on the northern side of the main Himalayan range. Spiti is home to around 10,000 people who share with their Tibetan neighbours a common ethnicity, language and culture. As it had recently opened to foreign tourism, we were keen to visit the valley, study the local culture, interact with a local school and trek across the Bhaba Pass. The one condition to go was to earn their cost. Bhaba Pass is a fine example of passes on the Greater Himalayan range, which are gradual towards the Tibetan plateau but fall steeply towards the southern side of the range.</p>

<p>With a team of 10 students from a grammar school in England, we embarked on my 2nd and my team’s 1st journey to one of my favourite valleys in India. Spiti Valley. We had flown to Delhi and decided to take an overnight bus ride from there into the dusty market town of Manali at the foothills of the Himalayas. Beyond Manali, the road becomes a series of switchbacks through a pine forest all the way to Kunzum Pass. On the far side of the pass the Spiti Valley soon opened up – a sliver of flat land lined on either side; a continuation of serrated peaks, their summits streaked by veins of lingering ice. Occasionally, the triangular heads of snow-covered mountains reared above these ramparts. The overwhelming colour was brown, in all its variations, broken only by the inky cobalt of the sky and the bottle green of the Spiti River.</p>

<p>From Manali, we arrived at Kibber the next day. Kibber is a 1½ hr journey from Kaza, district headquarter and the largest town in the valley. The single and rickety bus service was packed to the roof. But the journey was made interesting with beautiful landscapes and the local women singing all through the way.</p>

<p>The villagers were hospitable to the students and me, just like before. And it was amazing to see the two diverse cultures of the world – the West and the East – work so closely together. The students spoke no Hindi at all, while students of the school at Kibber spoke little or no English. And yet they introduced themselves, played games, painted the school, danced and laughed together as if language was never a barrier between them. Stewart, one of my team members, was amazed by the simplicity and happiness of the villagers and Jenny, expressed her pleasure at the reception they received, noting ‘how moved the villagers were on seeing us work with them to paint their school. I must have done a really good thing.’ Unknowingly, though, the local people had made a great impact on us as well. We realised a slow process of transformation within us; the realisation that things we believed to be necessities were only luxuries and drove home the importance of simple living after we experienced their lifestyle.</p>

<p>The day one of our tekking schedule from Kibber, took us past the wondrously located Kee Gompa. This beautiful temple, surrounded by terraces, was set above the road, overlooking the Spiti River. So beautiful was the view that it inspired us to go out on a photographic expedition. At the end of the first day everyone was ‘pooped’. The only happy creature was the local village dog, a mastiff we called ‘Rab’, who had decided to attach himself to our group.</p>

<p>Day two heralded a new dawn and we experienced spiritual awakening as we passed another monastery decorated in vivid colours of red, yellow, gold and blue. There were monks in red robes, Tibetan prayer flags like bunting in the breeze and rows of traditional prayer wheels, turned slowly by devotional Buddhists. After a lunch of vegetable dumplings, we moved on to the camp above a village named Dungal. Rab decided to sleep outside the girls’ tent, as if protecting them from intruders and no kind of enticement could induce him to move away.</p>

<p>Day three took us through the small village of Dungal, on a path that winds its way below a village gompa perched on a ridge top. Bush wood collected through the summer for the dreadful winter lined the flat-roofed houses like the ‘wood of life’. Small fields sown with barley and over a meter high swayed in the strong, high-altitude sun. An old mother in salwar-kameez (a local dress worn by women in India) with a triangular shawl thrown over her shoulders stood beside the path, holding her baby as if waiting for it to ripen. Children played with home-made toys, wiping their running noses with the sleeves of their torn jackets. Their chapped cheeks, baked by the cold and the sun, looked like roasted cakes. ‘It is a hard place to live, man,’ said Graeme, pointing out too there were no men to be seen anywhere.</p>

<p>Exhausted from the long strenuous day activities, we camped alongside Dhankar Lake, an 800m x 150m of luxury at the top of the world! Barely did we reach the site when Jenny and Anna, sweating from the walk put on their costumes and jumped in. The leader of the day decided to give the following day as rest. For the team this was bliss.</p>

<p>On the fourth day, after having a breakfast of spicy masala omelettes and hot buttered chapatis (Tashi who came along with us was our cook) we decided to start phase two, the crossing of the Bhaba Pass. The prospect of a minimum of six hours hiking up from the base and two days across into the Satluj valley meant that we would have to get our legs and lungs into shape, and that in turn meant lots of preparatory short walks.</p>

<p>This was an educational tour: a tour for the students and by the students. They led the trek, kept accounts, pitched their own tents, decided the day’s menu and planned the itinerary from Kibber to Dhankar monastery and into the Pin valley to the base of Bhaba Pass.</p>

  </header>

    <p>Marketing is an extremely important thing from point of view of the growth of any company. One needs to be innovative and market his or her product in the most attractive way possible. If you stay under the impression that it’s just business and don’t start advertising properly then you may face some losses as you wont gain enough customers. Many people think of starting up their own small business but only the few who market it well go ahead and become successful. If you don’t market your business you could end up going bankrupt. Given below are some marketing strategies that may come in handy to help you market your small business.</p>

<p>1: Manage time properly and think big:</p>

<p>You should not at all care about the size of your business whether it is small or large. You should always think big and feel like you are the most successful man or woman on this earth. This will help develop confidence in yourself and also in your customers. You should spend as much time as possible on your customers satisfying all their needs because word of mouth publicity is the best marketing that you can do.</p>

<p>2: Maintain uniqueness:</p>

<p>You should try and do something unique for your customers. Many shopping malls provide you with free car washing or free crèches while you shop. Obviously, people will prefer to go to this mall rather than any mall available quite close by to their homes. Thus, you must maintain uniqueness in your services. One should always remember that when you give something extra, you gain something extra.</p>

<p>3: Relate to your customers:</p>

<p>Forming a good relationship with your customers can help make you gain more business. Make a record of their birthdays and anniversaries and mail them regularly on any festivals. While you mail them don’t forget to add your address and contact number at the end of the mail making sure that they will contact you as soon as they need to. Customers are the ones who help us advertise ourselves, thus to keep them happy is an extremely important duty for your small business.</p>

<p>4: Keep a track through the internet:</p>

<p>Try and collect the email addresses of all your customers as a part of your marketing campaign. You can always send an e-mail of lucrative offers to them. They will make use of these offers and will in turn let their friends know and you could get more customers.</p>

<p>5: Check your employees:</p>

<p>Having rude and unhelpful employees may cost you a lot of business. Especially the staff of your company that deals with the customers should be polite and nice and should always be ready to help. This may help develop your reputation.</p>

<p>6: Make online sales and advertisements:</p>

<p>You should make buying and selling services available on your website and put up ads on all possible websites for the convenience of your customers to find you and to gain more customers. Research’s say that the online market has gone up by a huge ratio in the recent years and as the experts say you should be in touch with the fast moving world but also don’t forget other methods of reaching your customers like PR or newspaper advertising for instance.</p>

  </header>

    <p>To a child who’s about to have a party, there’s nothing more important than this event! This could potentially be the highlight of his or her year! So moms and dads…these kid birthday party ideas are here to help have a fun party that runs smoothly! So there won’t be any tears afterwords from you or your child!</p>

<p>Planning a party for children can sometimes be kind of overwhelming if you’re not up to the task. That is why the first thing you need to do is get a party checklist before going into battle! Next ask the child what kind of party he or she wants to have. The average kids birthday party contains some sort of a theme.</p>

<p>Once a child has expressed a theme or an idea about what kind of party the child wants to have, all you have to do is to follow up on this idea. Make sure your kids birthday party doesn’t clash with any major holidays, Mothers Day, Easter. Also check school holidays, make sure invited guests won’t be away.</p>

<p>There are things that have to be included in a kids birthday party at all costs! The fun and excitement of the children depend on it! One of them is games. This is very important for the entertainment factor…What’s a children’s party without games?</p>

<p>If you are playing games in your home, make sure to put away any breakables. Child proof your home so there will be no worries. You might want to play a game the kids like, quite a few times if they are enjoying it. Don’t be in a hurry to get to the next game. But don’t over do the same game either.</p>

<p>Also remember to have extra games ready to play in case you need a time filler. It is better to have too many games than not enough. Have party game prizes labeled, it will help keep you organized. Maybe label them boy or girl, if that fits, and always have extra in-case you play a game more than you planned.</p>

<p>Make sure you add decorations to your list of things to purchase for your kids birthday party. Balloons, streamers, party hats, all help ensure that the party you are throwing becomes a fun and festive occasion.</p>

<p>The food you serve should be something that children will love…not a ‘great appetizer recipe’ you think sounds good…save that for another day and bring in the hot-dogs and ice cream!</p>

<p>Lastly, make sure that each and every child has a parting gift that they can take home with them. A lot of party stores carry goody bags that you can fill with special treats and toys. Put names on the party favor bags to make sure everyone gets one.</p>

<p>Keep them out of sight until the end of the party and give them away as the guests are leaving, then the favors won’t be scattered through your house and kids won’t be missing little goodies…and have a party favor bag for your birthday child. After all it is their special day, and you don’t want your child feeling left out.</p>

<p>By following these quick and easy kid birthday party ideas and tips, you will now be able to throw the kids birthday party of the century. Your child is going to be so happy and you are going to be thrilled that you made his or her party so great and successful!</p>

  </header>

    <p>This interesting article addresses some of the key issues regarding healthy sleep habits. A careful reading of this material could make a big difference in how you think about healthy sleep habits to children. Healthy sleep habits for children are as significant as they are a necessary for health, proper growth and well-being.</p>

<p>Children, who get sufficient amount sleep every night function better throughout the day, are more alert, and their concentration, performance and memory are better than those who don’t sleep well. As well children with sleep problems are less likely to develop behavioral problems of any kind, moodiness, anxiety or depression.</p>

<p>The needs of sleep differ from child to child but school age children in general require in the area of nine to twelve hours of sleep per night. Consider these things if you are unsure whether or not your child is getting enough sleep every night.</p>

<p>• If he/she wakes up easily in the morning that is a good sign</p>

<p>• If he/she is wide awake, energetic and alert throughout the school day then the nighttime sleep is sufficient.</p>

<p>• If a child can fall asleep within a period of fifteen minutes to a half an hour than he or she is getting enough sleep</p>

<p>It is significant to explain to your child why getting enough sleep every night is significant, not only in terms of his/her health but also for performance in school and other activities such as sports, music, playtime, etc.</p>

<p>Bedtime Routines</p>

<p>Above all else developing and following a routine before bedtime is the number one tip to encourage good sleep habits in your child is to. A routine is good for children because children like predictability and a bedtime routine makes it easier for a kid to calm down after their busy day, crawl into bed and drift off to sleep.</p>

<p>A typical bedtime routine for a child should look something like this- a light snack, a relaxing bath, dry off and put on pajamas, wash face and brush teeth, read a bedtime story and then it’s good night and lights out.</p>

<p>Same Bedtime</p>

<p>Stick to the same bedtime every night. An occasional change in the bedtime routine, such as when grandparents visit or during a holiday weekend is one thing, but for the most part, a consistent routine is best.</p>

<p>Children’s Bedroom</p>

<p>Always make sure that a child’s room is at a comfortable temperature and that it is peaceful and quiet. Also many children do not want to be left in the total darkness while they sleep so getting a nightlight is a worthwhile purchase to make.</p>

<p>Stress</p>

<p>Stress can cause sleepless nights for children so always encourage your son or daughter to talk with you about any concerns or worries he or she is having, whether they be family problems, school related problems and so on.</p>

<p>You may not consider everything you just read to be crucial information about healthy sleep habits for your children. But don’t be surprised if you find yourself recalling and using this very information in the next few days.</p>

<p>Cut-off Time for Entertainment</p>

<p>It is an excellent idea to devise a specific cut-off time for entertainment for your child, in terms of television, video games, and the computer and so on. It is not a good idea to have a television or a computer in a child’s bedroom, as they can be easily distracted or tempted to play after they are told, “Enough for today.”</p>

<p>It is an even better idea to cease television, computer or videos an hour before bedtime in order to make the preparation for sleep a calm and relaxing experience. A child does not need anything stimulating before bedtime.</p>

<p>Sleep Disorders for Children</p>

<p>Children can suffer from sleep disorders just like people of any age can. Sleep apnea, insomnia, enuresis (bed wetting), bruxism (teeth grinding), asthma that is nocturnal in nature and nightmares can all occur in children.</p>

<p>You make a visit to the doctor to decide upon a course of action, the better, if your child is having problems with sleep the sooner.</p>

<p>Educate Your Child about Sleep</p>

<p>Try to make the whole sleep experience as positive and uplifting as can be. Encourage your child to learn how to fall asleep on his/her own and not to need to rely on you.</p>

<p>Research has proven that a child sleeping in a parent’s bed runs a risk of them suffocating or being strangled and also fosters dependence to an unhealthy extent. None of these things are as likely to happen when the child is alone in their own bed.</p>

<p>It is the kid who can be alone and fall asleep by him/herself who learns better how to cope with moments when he or she is awakened during the night. The only time that you might want to stay with your child until they fall asleep is if they are sick or extremely fearful.</p>

<p>Take time to consider the points presented above. What you learn may help you overcome your hesitation to take action.</p>

    <p>As the last rays of summer’s warmth ebb away and the gentle breezes of autumn waft themselves upon us, we recognize once again, that change is inevitable. Nature is constantly changing and yet, so many people have the notion that change is frightening.</p>

<p>People are creatures of habit and some find it difficult to adjust to changes that are certain to come our way. Life is like an old, comfortable pair of shoes. We may realize that we need new ones and we may even find new ones we really like, but, we know that changing will cause us discomfort for a little while until we break them in.</p>

<p>Sometimes we need to realize that life isn’t always easy. What may be better for us is not what we are used to, but it is certainly worth the trouble of breaking in new habits and lifestyle changes.</p>

<p>Change does not have to be painful. Just look to nature and it will give you clues to how change can be effortless. The beautifully colored autumn leaves do not hang on to the old tree for dear life. No, they yield to the changes with ease and float gently off the tree.</p>

<p>With the coming of autumn we have been busy in our gardens pulling up the old stuff and getting ready for a time of rest. We know that the ground must rest and next year there will be more wonderful things in our garden to delight us.</p>

<p>Are there things in your life that need to be gently eased out of your life? Maybe there are bad relationships or habits or thoughts that need to be weeded out of your life. Don’t be afraid to do a little gardening in your own life.</p>

<p>Every gardener knows that unless we get to the roots, we really are not getting rid of the problem. It may go away for awhile but unless we get to the root, it will sneak back into the garden very quickly.</p>

<p>Although the harvest time is here there is no time to stop weeding the garden of our minds. This garden needs constant attention in order for us to flourish and be all that we can be. The only way to keep this garden in top shape is to make sure that no weeds are there trying to strangle any good we are trying to do. The weeds of our mind, of course are negative thoughts that like to creep in and keep us from achieving that which we are striving for.</p>

<p>William James said, “Human beings, by changing the inner attitudes of their minds, can change the outer aspects of their lives.</p>

<p>How do we change the inner attitudes of our minds? By changing the way we think. We must put fear and negativity behind us. How, you ask? Just as the leaves of autumn gently blow from the tree, don’t try and make a change in your thinking over night and expect to get instant results. We cannot rip these thoughts out of our minds, as much as we would like to sometimes. No, we need to be gentle on ourselves and let positive thoughts replace the negative.</p>

<p>Yes it will take some work on your part. You must constantly fill your mind with positive thoughts. Proverbs 27: 3 says, As a man thinker in his heart, so is he. We are what we think. When the negative thoughts come into your mind, you must be ready and willing to replace those thoughts with positive ones. Just say to yourself, no, I won’t let that thought take over my mind, I will think positively. Affirmations are good to have readily available so you can replace the negative thought with the positive one. It won’t be easy, it won’t be hard either, it will just be different, like that new pair of shoes we were talking about earlier.</p>

<p>The autumn leaves fall to make way for new life. We too must go through changes that will bring new growth to our bodies, souls and spirits.</p>

<p>Change is inevitable, so why fight it? Why be afraid of it? Yes, change will require us to do a bit of readjusting but it is always worth it. Don’t be afraid of change, a change will do you good.</p>
