  </header>

    <p>Most of the time when you fail or experience pain and depression due to frustrating events in your life, you are inclined to blame external elements or even other people for your misfortunes. Although it happens that you encounter trouble caused by things beyond and outside of yourself, there are also certain aspects in your personage you tend to overlook, which eventually gave way to such dismal outcomes.</p>

<p>Changing how you think is changing yourself. Easier said than done. In actuality, altering your perception of things and the world at large is nowhere near as easy as just mouthing the words to yourself. The beliefs you hold in your mind are lifelong products of your experiences and influences, strengthened and produced since your childhood days. Referred to as “core beliefs”, these staunch ideas are inherent to each one of us, and they play a crucial role determining the course our lives would take.</p>

<p>Since they are deeply ingrained into your psyche, you cannot expect to change or replace them overnight. The time it took for them take root into your subconscious has given them a firm hold, which implies that conscious effort, strong will, and the desire to change are necessitated on your part. To your advantage, managing to change your pessimistic or illogical core beliefs to positive, beneficial ones would strengthen your sense of self and boost your self-esteem. In effect, you stand a better chance against surviving pain and overcoming depression and anxiety should you encounter the force of life’s difficulties.</p>

<p>To start you off, here are some common negative core beliefs and the suggested positive ones you can use to take their place.</p>

<p>Winning and success are inborn traits.</p>

<p>Given that each one of us is endowed with inherent potentials to help us succeed, not tapping into them and using them incorrectly would definitely mark us for certain failure.</p>

<p>Suggested replacement: Winning and success are dependent on my will to win and succeed.</p>

<p>I am who others think I am.</p>

<p>Huge mistake. The way you see yourself is the image you project to others, which in turn is reflected back to you. Determining the kind of person you want to be is dependent entirely on your own will and what kind of person you think yourself to be.</p>

<p>Suggested replacement: I am the best person I could possibly be.</p>

<p>Difficulty would only bring pain.</p>

<p>Although facing hardships is not a walk in the park, allowing yourself to just focus on their negative aspect and resigning yourself to the perimeters of your comfort zone for the rest of your life would be detrimental to no one else but yourself. Remember: In order to extract the juice of an orange, it has to be squeezed first. Like you, you would not realize the apex of your capacity if you steer clear from all sorts of difficulty.</p>

<p>Suggested replacement: Overcoming difficulty would bring out the best in me.</p>

<p>I am just as good as everybody else.</p>

<p>Being one with the crowd does have its advantage: mediocrity and a free ticket for not achieving self-fulfilment. Studies conducted at Harvard University have confirmed that every person has at least one ingenious trait, meaning there has to be one area in life where each of us can excel. But the challenge lies with determining what this area is. To do so requires courage to defy our self-consciousness by realizing our true potentials.</p>

<p>Suggested replacement: I am as excellent as I choose myself to be.</p>

  </header>

    <p>We all make New Year resolutions. We draw a long list of do’s and don’ts on the New Year eve. And manage to break most of the resolutions within one to two months. A birthday is only for celebrations. What if instead of making resolutions on New Year we make them on our birthdays? New Year is common to all, but birthdays are individual, and the resolution may therefore have a lasting impact.</p>

<p>These are my resolutions on my birthday. I wonder about how many readers will agree with them, but please read on. I will become a good person now onwards. I know that I am already a good person, but I will try to make myself better. I will not hurt anyone with my words or deed. I will be compassionate towards all and will control my anger as much as possible. I will release my love to all and keep my hatreds and dislikes to myself. I will try to do a work that gives me money but also gives something to the society. I will help everyone who I can help. I will work truthfully and be honest in my dealings with my co-workers even if that hurts me. I will try to donate to charities as much as I can and I will try to join some volunteer organizations to help society. I will pray for all and make confessions to God about my mistakes everyday. I will forgive all who hurt me and forget past acrimony. I don’t know when death will approach me, so I will always be alert about my actions and act in the way that pleases my maker.</p>

<p>How about making some e-cards with such resolutions and sending them to our friends on our birthday? We would be receiving lot many e-cards on our birthday. In response, we can send a thank you card and add these resolutions or something else like this and send back to let others know of our resolutions? Birthday is the right time to make resolutions and improve our life.</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2013/11/18/iron-in-water/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Iron in Water</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>Iron is one of the most troublesome elements in water supplies. Making up at least 5 percent of the earth’s crust, iron is one of the earth’s most plentiful resources. Rainwater as it infiltrates the soil and underlying geologic formations dissolves iron, causing it to seep into aquifers that serve as sources of groundwater for wells. Although present in drinking water, iron is seldom found at concentrations greater than 10 milligrams per liter (mg/l) or 10 parts per million. However, as little as 0.3 mg/l can cause water to turn a reddish brown color. We experience red, brown, or yellow staining of laundry, glassware, dishes and household fixtures such as bathtubs and sinks. The water may also have a metallic taste and an offensive odor. Water system piping and fixtures can also become restricted or clogged.</p>

<p>There are two types of iron in general:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Soluble: “Clear water” iron, is the most common form and the one that creates the most complaints by water users.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insoluble: When insoluble iron, or “red water” iron is poured into a glass, it appears rusty or has a red or yellow color.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Treat your water:</p>

<p>Once you determine whether you have “clear water”, “red water”, “organic” or “bacterial” iron in your water, you can take steps to correct the problem. Keep in mind that no one treatment method will work for every type of iron problem.</p>

<p>A complete water test to determine the extent of your iron problem and possible treatment solutions should include tests for iron concentration, iron bacteria, pH, alkalinity, and hardness.</p>

<p>If you receive your water from a public water system and experience red water problems, it is important to contact a utility official to determine whether the red water is from the public system or your home’s plumbing or piping. Before going further ask yourselves question like:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What form of iron do I have in my water system?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the water test results, will the water treatment unit remove the total iron concentration? (Total iron includes both soluble and insoluble iron.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the treatment unit treat the water at the flow rate required for my water system?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the pH have to be adjusted prior to a particular treatment?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the construction of a new well or the reconstruction of an existing well be more cost effective than a long-term iron removal treatment process?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now you can choose from various methods from Aeration Filtration, Water Softener, Manganese Greensand, Catalytic Filtration, Ion Exchange, Sequestering and Chlorination.</p>

<p>Iron is common household water contaminants with no known direct health effects at levels found in water. Their presence may cause staining and offensive tastes and odors. Remember, the type of water you have will determine what type of treatment is possible. No one treatment technique works for every iron problem. In some cases, well construction or reconstruction may be more cost effective than treatment</p>

      <a class="post-link" href="/2013/11/11/way-to-burn-fat-and-keep-it-off/"><h3 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline">Way To Burn Fat And Keep It Off</h3> </a>

  </header>

    <p>What is the best way to burn fat off your body, and look and feel absolutely terrific? It sounds almost like a dream for many people. However, while everyone’s bodies and goals may be different, there are some basic fat loss principles that will help you burn fat fast.</p>

<p>The first thing you want to do is take a look at your current diet and make a decision to start making long-term improvements. This may involve replacing bad habits such as snacking on chocolate bars with new positive habits such as resorting to fruits and nuts for snacks.</p>

<p>When being asked for diet advice, I always recommend cutting way back on sugary drinks, fried foods and other foods high in sugar and unhealthy fats. I also recommend sticking to natural and unprocessed sources of foods as much as possible. Really, is it any surprise that 35% of Americans are obese when the average American diet is pizza, fried foods, pastries, donuts, ice cream, soft drinks, sodas, beers, and whatever else we’re polluting our bodies with?</p>

<p>When you begin a program to lose fat, it is easy to fall into the habit of cutting calories. Most dieters do exactly that, drastically lowering their calories to the point where they aren’t losing fat, they’re unknowingly burning up muscle tissue. As a result, their body starts to use fewer calories to maintain itself and they find themselves gaining fat much easier when they finish their diet.</p>

<p>So if reducing your calories is not the best way to burn fat, what is? Well, instead of focusing on depriving yourself, and increasing the chances of burning muscle tissue, focus on eating small, frequent and healthy meals and perform regular fat-burning aerobic exercise. Fortunately, you don’t have to spend your life in the gym as there are many ways of exercising. Who knows, you might choose to get an exercise video to work out with if that suits your lifestyle, or you may decide to pick up a sport you could enjoy.</p>

<p>Performing the right type of aerobic exercise not only burns fat through the workout itself, but it also increases the calories you burn after the workout, increases production of specific enzymes and hormones which promote fat burning, and increase your insulin sensitivity, resulting in less carbohydrates being stored as fat. Apart from being the best way to burn fat it is a great way to increase your general health and fitness.</p>

<p>If I told you that by adding another part to the fat loss equation you could not only multiply your results, but at the same time get stronger, improve your exercise performance, prevent injuries and much more, while achieving a more toned appearance and a huge confidence boost, would you be interested?</p>

<p>Simply eating smaller healthier meals and performing regular aerobic exercise will begin the fat loss process, but the best way to burn fat also includes strength training. It will stop your body eating away your muscle tissue, and also build muscle at the same time which means that, since muscle tissue needs energy to be maintained, your metabolism will increase significantly as your body will need more calories as your muscles develop.</p>

<p>To get the biggest benefits from strength training consider lifting weights regularly, although body weight workouts are also very beneficial. Not only does your metabolism become faster allowing you to burn more calories even while resting, you’ll also find that your aerobic workouts will burn more calories as a result of the increased muscle.</p>

<p>Avoid the hype out there telling you that simply lowering calories will magically strip the fat off your body. Eating frequent, small and healthy meals, performing regular fat-burning aerobic exercise and strengthening and building muscle is the best way to burn fat fast and keep it off for good</p>

  </header>

    <p>By logging on to the net, you are at risk at once. Online security threats are a big challenge today. There are several types of threats on the internet.The main threats are Spy-ware, Viruses and Hackers.</p>

<p>It is absolutely necessary to protect yourself, your computer and your personal information from these threats. Use all the security software needed.There are three security software applications you should have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Firewall Protection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anti-virus Software</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anti Spy-ware Software</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should also be aware of your passwords, and protection of these.</p>

<p>A good thing to remember is to never use the same password for all your accounts, and never share it with anyone. Do not store your passwords on your computer either. Use passwords that contains both</p>

<p>letters and numbers and preferably special characters.</p>

<p>You have most likely been attacked by spy-ware programs once or more. It is the most common online threat. Spy-ware is software designed to steal information from your computer. It installs without your knowledge, and sends information such as passwords, credit card information, documents, bank account details, and much more.</p>

<p>Types of spy-ware could be: Trojan horses, key loggers, dialer, and ad-ware programs. Anti-spy-ware software could protect you from these threats, and there are several brands to choose from. Many are great applications, but some of them are just dealing with a specific problem. Avoid these.Anti virus software is necessary to protect yourself from viruses. Many viruses are sent via email as an attachment, and others are sent through file-sharing applications. Others are sent via instant messaging programs such as Windows MSN. With a good anti-virus solution that auto updates itself, you should be well protected. It is a good idea to scan all files that you download, and check all incoming mails too. Many anti virus programs are installed with a email scanner.Firewall is necessary to prevent your computer from being intruded by hackers. This software controls every application on your computer that has a network connection, and blocks access from those you don’t allow to connect. A good tip for Windows XP users is to make sure that the included firewall is turned on. You might think that you have to spend loads of money to be protected online. This doesn’t have to be right. There are many great free applications on the net, but the paid ones are usually better.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that you should have some kind of protection, because without you are totally naked to these threats.</p>
